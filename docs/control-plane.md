# The platform control plane

The hosted door for vivijure studio (epic #40, skeleton #52). A **separate Worker** from the studio
that deploys independently, exactly like the MCP Worker: `npm run deploy:control-plane`.

It owns accounts, auth, the AUP gate, tenant records, and the admin switches. It owns **no tenant
studio data**.

## Parity, stated up front

This control plane ships **AGPL in this repo like everything else**. Anyone may run a competing
hosted vivijure from exactly this source, with our blessing.

The hosted tier sells convenience (no install, no infra), never capability. There is no community
edition and no pay-gated feature, ever. That is not a promise bolted onto the architecture; it is a
property of it: the control plane provisions **the published studio release, unmodified**, so there
is no hosted fork of the studio that could drift away from self-host.

## Why studio-instance-per-tenant

Every tenant gets their own complete studio: their own Worker (a user Worker in a Workers for
Platforms dispatch namespace), their own D1, their own R2 bucket, their own secrets.

The alternative (adding `tenant_id` to every studio table) was rejected. The studio is
**single-operator by design** (the #292 identity strip); "no per-user scoping" is a load-bearing
simplification across renders-db, cast-db, the spend counter, and module config. Reversing it would
fork hosted behavior away from self-host inside the core and touch every query in the render spine.

Instance-per-tenant makes every single-operator assumption stay true, because **each tenant IS the
operator of their own studio**.

## Data boundary (enforced, not just documented)

The control-plane D1 holds `accounts`, `account_identities`, `login_tokens`, `sessions`,
`oauth_states`, `tenants`, `aup_acceptances`, `provision_jobs`, `platform_settings`, `admin_audit`.

Tenant studio data (projects, storyboards, renders, cast, spend) lives in the **tenant's own D1**
and never here. `tests/control-plane/schema-guard.test.ts` fails the build if a studio table ever
appears in `migrations-control-plane/`, so the boundary is a test rather than a sentence.

**Every stored credential is a SHA-256 hash**, never a plaintext (the `api_tokens` rule, #445): a
dump of this database yields no usable credential. The schema guard also fails on any
credential-shaped column that is not a `*_hash`.

## Key custody (the whole security story)

Two keys, and the split is the point:

| | Key A: provisioning | Key B: stored |
|---|---|---|
| Shape | Restricted, `api.runpod.io/graphql` = Read/Write, invoke = None | Restricted, invoke scoped to the tenant's 4 endpoints |
| Lifetime | **Transient.** Used once, never stored anywhere | Stored as a secret on the tenant's own studio |
| Blast radius | The whole RunPod account (RunPod's own stated risk) | Invoke those 4 endpoints, 403 elsewhere |

**Onboarding is two-phase, and it has to be.** RunPod API keys are console-minted only (no API
creates them), and a key cannot be scoped to endpoints that do not exist yet. So key B is
physically impossible to create until key A has already provisioned the endpoints:

```
paste key A -> provision the 4 endpoints -> status awaiting_invoke_key
            -> tenant mints key B in the RunPod console, scoped to those 4
            -> paste key B -> verified, installed as a studio secret -> live
```

Key B is **verified before it is ever stored** (`runpod-invoke-key.ts`): if it can reach GraphQL it
is a provisioning-capable key and is refused outright, because storing it would throw away the
entire custody win. The tenant is told exactly why. The probe semantics are the empirically
resolved #60 matrix, not documentation.

A consequence worth stating plainly: because key A is never stored, a provision job that fails **in
the RunPod steps** cannot resume itself. `/retry` answers `409 runpod_key_required` and the tenant
re-pastes. CF-side steps (D1, R2, WfP upload) resume with no key at all. That is the honest cost of
never holding the powerful key.

## The AUP gate

Versioned, blocking, logged, and in front of provisioning from day one, so no tenant studio can
exist without a recorded acceptance by a known account. The CSAM bright line is absolute; the GPUs
are the tenant's, the surface is ours.

The gate is a **lookup for the current version**, never a boolean on the account. Bumping
`AUP_VERSION` re-gates everyone on their next request, by construction, with no migration and no
backfill. A boolean would silently grandfather every existing account through changed text.

Acceptance records hash the IP rather than storing it raw: the record must prove who accepted what
and when, which a hash does, without turning the log into a location dataset.

## Auth

| Method | Status |
|---|---|
| Magic link | postern `POST /api/send`; the sender identity is BOUND to our token by postern's registry, so we never pass a `From` |
| Google | OIDC, hand-rolled, PKCE |
| GitHub | OAuth, hand-rolled |
| Apple | **Seam only.** Appears the day Team ID + Services ID + .p8 are staged; no code change |

`GET /api/platform/config` projects `auth_methods` from **what is actually configured** (id AND
secret both present). The front door renders buttons from that array and hardcodes nothing: the same
registry-projection rule the studio UI follows. A half-configured provider is absent, not broken.

**The one security invariant:** a provider identity may only reach an account when the provider
asserts the email as **verified** (Google's `email_verified`; GitHub's primary+verified address from
`/user/emails`, never the profile field). Without this rule, anyone who can set an unverified email
at any provider inherits the matching vivijure account. `upsertAccountForVerifiedEmail` is the one
place accounts are linked, so every provider obeys it.

Sessions are `__Host-` cookies (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax). `__Host-` matters specifically
because tenant studios are sibling subdomains; `Lax` is required because the magic-link click and
the SSO callback are top-level cross-site GETs that `Strict` would drop.

## Tenants

`slug` is **both** a DNS label (`<slug>.studio.vivijure.com`) and the WfP script name, so it is
validated once against the intersection of both alphabets, plus a reserved list so a tenant cannot
mint a hostname that impersonates a platform surface.

**Suspension is orthogonal to lifecycle.** `status` is the lifecycle
(`pending | provisioning | awaiting_invoke_key | live | failed | deleting | deleted`); `suspended_at`
is a separate flag that the API projects over the top as `status: "suspended"`.

This is not stylistic. Storing suspension *in* the status column destroys the lifecycle state it
overwrites, so resume has to guess where to return to, and guessing "live" silently promoted a
never-provisioned tenant to live with a URL to a studio that did not exist. Two independent facts
need two independent columns. (Caught on a real D1 during the #52 live verify; the unit suite had
only ever suspended an already-live tenant. Regression test: `routes.test.ts`.)

## Admin switches

Bearer token (`CONTROL_PLANE_ADMIN_TOKEN`), constant-time compared, reusing the studio's proven
gate. **Unset means no admin surface, not an open one.** Every action is audited; a suspend without
a reason is refused, because the kill switch must stay attributable.

- Per-tenant suspend/resume: pulls the tenant's routing instantly, independent of their own studio.
- Global `signups_enabled`: DB-backed, not a var, so it flips **without a deploy**. There is no
  tenant cap by ruling (R2 spend is the governing meter); this switch doubles as the waitlist gate.
  It closes the door to NEW accounts only and never locks out people who already have one.

## Config

Bindings live in `wrangler.control-plane.toml.example` and are mirrored by hand in
`src/control-plane/env.ts` (the standing rule). `account_id` is never hardcoded. The rendered
`wrangler.control-plane.toml` is gitignored, like every other rendered config in this repo.

Naming: **"control-plane", never "platform"**. `src/platform/` is already the host-neutral Platform
ICD, and colliding with it would be a trap for the next reader.

## Verifying changes

```bash
npm run typecheck                 # the CI gate
npm test                          # includes tests/control-plane
npm run dev:control-plane         # live, against a real local D1
```

The in-memory store in `tests/control-plane/memory-store.ts` proves **decision paths only**. It is
not evidence about the shipped artifact: it encodes assumptions about our own SQL and would happily
agree with a bug in it. `store-d1.ts` is the one un-stubbable seam and is verified against a **real
D1** via `wrangler dev`. Both halves are required; the live pass is what caught the suspend defect
above.

## Scope: what is NOT here yet

#52 is the skeleton. The provision routes create real tenant and job rows and enforce the real
gates, but the **job runner** (D1 create/migrate, R2 bucket + scoped creds, WfP upload, RunPod
endpoints) lands in #53/#54. A tenant created today parks at `pending` with a `queued` job until
that runner ships, and nothing claims otherwise to the caller. Routing/domains are #55, quotas #56,
AUP text #57, onboarding UX #58.
