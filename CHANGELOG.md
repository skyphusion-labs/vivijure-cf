# Changelog

Notable changes per release. SemVer-style (pre-1.0: PATCH for fixes / backend-only tweaks, MINOR
for new features). Newest first.

**Dual-panel release gate:** every studio feature ships to vivijure-cf and vivijure-local in the
same release wave ([[vivijure-hosted-parity-absolute]] in fleet memory:
`fleet-chezmoi/claude-memory/projects/-home-conrad-dev-vivijure/memory/vivijure-hosted-parity-absolute.md`).

## Unreleased

## v1.7.10 -- 2026-07-22

PATCH: dual-panel with vivijure-local **v1.1.11**. Core pin unchanged (`^1.2.5`).

- **fix(security):** validate cast image MIME on import/JSON media paths; sniff magic bytes; force safe content-type, `nosniff`, and `Content-Disposition: attachment` on `/api/artifact` (#193)
- **ci:** adversarial security audit workflow

## v1.7.9 -- 2026-07-22

PATCH: dual-panel with vivijure-local **v1.1.10** -- pin `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core` to `^1.2.5`
(cf#110 film phase `from` recovery + core#54 `HookCatalogEntry.order`), and sort Stages / planner
render panels by `catalog[].order` (drop hardcoded HOOK_ORDER / PANEL_ORDER).

- **docs(release):** top-level PIN digest is studio-only; module bundles stay self-anchored (cf#147).
- **ci:** `tsc -p tsconfig.tests.json` in `npm run typecheck` so tests/ cannot silently drift (cf#107).
- **ci:** CodeQL now extracts `public/` (studio front-door JS); dropped from `paths-ignore` (cf#128).
- **ci:** adversarial security audit workflow on a schedule (`ADVERSARIAL_AUDIT_CF_API_TOKEN`).

## v1.7.8 -- 2026-07-22

PATCH: re-list `alibaba-wan-lora` in IaC after 2x2 Wan LoRA sign-off (cf#29 follow-up), and bump
`sharp` to 0.35.3 (GHSA-f88m-g3jw-g9cj / cf#178 Dependabot residue). Uncomments
`MODULE_ALIBABA_WAN_LORA` in `wrangler.toml.example` and clears the CI deploy `EXCLUDE` so the next
tag deploy keeps the live binding. Local panel already carries the module via compose profile.

## v1.7.7 -- 2026-07-22

MINOR: pre-submit RunPod idle workersMax reconcile (cf#61). Bumps `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core`
to `^1.2.4`. All RunPod module workers (`own-gpu`, `keyframe`, finish satellites, `speech-upscale`)
reconcile `workersMax` via REST PATCH before `/run` when `RUNPOD_WORKERS_MAX` is set; operator batch
script `scripts/reconcile-runpod-endpoints.ts` for management keys. Scoped invoke keys get honest
idle-scale-down guidance instead of cryptic cold-start failures.

## v1.7.6 -- 2026-07-21

PATCH: bump `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core` to `^1.2.3` (#53 advanceFilmJob wedge fix, local#99
`output_key` honesty). Ships core#64 + core#65.

## v1.7.5 -- 2026-07-21

PATCH: fix tag deploy CI (fc#859 follow-up). Removes duplicate ancestry guard from the deploy job
(`node:22-alpine` checkout has no `.git`, so `git fetch` always failed). The `assert-on-main` job
already gates tag deploys on ubuntu-latest. **Redeploy vehicle for v1.7.4** (core 1.2.2 legacy finish
order); prod did not deploy on v1.7.4 tag push.

## v1.7.4 -- 2026-07-21

PATCH: MuseTalk finish-order fix (cf#29). Bumps `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core` to `^1.2.2` so
dialogue shots default to legacy finish order (RIFE -> lipsync -> upscale). #584 reorder
(lipsync -> RIFE -> upscale) is opt-in via `finish_config["finish-order"].dialogue_reorder`.
Ships cf#179 + core#62.

## v1.7.3 -- 2026-07-21

PATCH: Wan LoRA UI + planner preflight parity (cf#29 follow-up). Implements existing dual-panel
doctrine: Cast page trains Wan via `POST /train-wan-lora`; planner `lora-preflight.js` is
motion-backend-aware (`wan_lora_key_high/low` on `alibaba-wan-lora`). Paired with vivijure-local
v1.1.3; Laura test + propagandhi redeploy remain gated until both PRs merge + ops CR apply.

## v1.7.2 -- 2026-07-20

PATCH: Wan cast LoRA harvest writeback (cf#29). Bumps `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core` to ^1.2.1 so
`/api/cast/:id/lora-status` polls the dedicated Wan train endpoint (`RUNPOD_WAN_TRAIN_ENDPOINT_ID`)
before the render endpoint, harvesting dual expert keys on COMPLETED. R2 reconcile backfills Wren-style
rows when RunPod retention drops the job but both experts exist under `loras/lora-{slug}-*/A/`.

Ship tag `v1.7.2` on merge `9c0c3c9` (#171). The `v1.7.1` git tag was already consumed by image-prep
rembg (#158); this release aligns the package version with the deployed tag.

Requires vivijure-core [PR #59](https://github.com/skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core/pull/59) published as
`1.2.1` before deploy.

## v1.7.1 -- 2026-07-20

PATCH: image-prep rembg 2.0.76 → 2.0.77 (#158). GHCR image-prep rebuilt; tag `v1.7.1` points at this
commit, not the Wan writeback release (see v1.7.2).

## v1.7.0 -- 2026-07-20

MINOR: Wan cast LoRA train + render projection (cf#29 Phase B/C). Unblocks D2c e2e against the
dedicated train endpoint.

- **Phase B (#153):** migration `0012` adds cast Wan LoRA expert-key columns.
- **Phase C Part 2 (#154):** Wan cast LoRA projection across render paths; studio route
  `POST /api/cast/:id/train-wan-lora`; Secrets Store binding `RUNPOD_WAN_TRAIN_ENDPOINT_ID`
  ← `BACKEND_RUNPOD_WAN_TRAIN_ENDPOINT_ID` (fail-closed; never falls back to the render EP).
- **Deps / CI hygiene** since v1.6.0: dependabot bumps + `assert-on-main` deploy guard (#151).

Requires a live Secrets Store seed of `BACKEND_RUNPOD_WAN_TRAIN_ENDPOINT_ID` (D2: `zqb7tougbqfkqa`)
before Wan train submits succeed. Cast UI still posts `/train-lora` (SDXL); Wan path is API-only
until `public/cast.js` is wired.

## v1.6.0 -- 2026-07-18

MINOR: the module contract gains a credential-readiness endpoint, and stops lying about a credential
that is configured but not yet served (cf#114, a launch gate under cf#40).

- **New module-contract endpoint `GET /ready`** on all five tenant modules (`keyframe`, `own-gpu`,
  `finish-upscale`, `finish-lipsync`, `speech-upscale`): `{ ok, module, credentials: { ... } }`,
  **booleans only, never values**. It answers a question nothing outside the module can: whether the
  version the edge is ACTUALLY SERVING can read its credentials. The platform API can only report
  that a secret NAME exists, which was true during the live failure this fixes.
- **Honest credential text.** The endpoint id is bound at module upload; the API key is written
  later as a secret. Endpoint-present + key-absent is therefore diagnostic of PROPAGATION, and now
  reads `credential not yet visible on this worker version (retry shortly)` instead of the previous
  `not configured` -- which sent a real tenant chasing a correctly-configured credential during the
  cf#99 finale. Both absent stays a genuine `not configured`.
- **The soft-degrade path carries the same distinction**: the polish modules degrade with
  `runpod-key-not-yet-visible` rather than `no-runpod-secrets`, so the honest-degrade record does
  not itself carry the lie. No polish step changed its fail/degrade behaviour.
- Contract documented in `docs/module-api.md`; module manifest versions bumped (a new endpoint is a
  surface change). Tenants pick this up on re-provision against the new pin.

## v1.5.0 -- 2026-07-18

MINOR: the chat/image surface becomes module territory (cf#129). The studio now hardcodes NO model
names at all; full record on the closed issue (completion contract).

- **New core hook `image.generate`** (core 1.1.0): modules declare image models in
  `config_schema.model` and return image BYTES; the core persists them. A module holds no bucket
  binding, so a write/serve split (cf#140's class) is structurally unrepresentable. First-party
  `modules/image-generate` carries the 11 image models with every learned per-model quirk.
- **Canonical `GET /api/models`** on both hosts: the full projected catalog (planning + image rows)
  from one generalized projection; `/api/storyboard/models` stays as a filtered view with an
  agreement test. Empty catalog = `200` + honest empty array, never 404, never backfill.
- **BREAKING (response shape): rows no longer carry a `provider` field.** The studio no longer has
  that knowledge -- dispatch belongs to the declaring module. Consumers wanting provenance read the
  declaring module via `GET /api/modules`.
- **Cast image pickers are catalog-fed.** All three project the served image rows through the shared
  render path with visible honest-fail states; the hardcoded silent flag-retry fallback model is
  removed (exhaustion now fails visibly, naming the model).
- **cf#140 fixed:** chat artifacts write the SERVED bucket; the portrait-gen preview renders. Fixed
  on main here; prod carries the fix from this tag (live-verify closes the issue).
- **Module deployability:** deploy ships `image-generate` (wrangler.toml + README + service binding
  were absent -- the module could never have deployed); the operator store secret
  `IMAGE_GENERATE_OPENAI_API_KEY` is OPTIONAL (absent = opaque instead of transparent PNG), and the
  installer placeholder is treated as absent so an unreplaced optional key degrades honestly instead
  of hard-failing.
- **Billing guard pinned by test:** plan-enhance's Anthropic call must emit `cf-aig-authorization`
  and must NEVER emit `x-api-key`, whatever is in env (recording proxy + positive control).
- Dead catalog rows (55), dead `streaming`/`byok_alias` flags, and the 11-file orphaned
  provider/parser island removed (cf#133).

## v1.4.0 -- 2026-07-18

MINOR: the bare-skeleton port (cf#62). The studio stops providing model names; plan.enhance modules
do. Full record on the closed issue (completion contract) and in docs/module-api.md.

- **Planning models are module-declared.** `modules/plan-enhance` carries its models in
  `config_schema.model` (including `anthropic/claude-sonnet-5`); `GET /api/storyboard/models` is a
  projection of EVERY installed plan.enhance module's enum -- no hardcoded list anywhere in core. A
  module with no model enum is listed under its own name and label. Third-party modules are honored
  per the contract with no special-casing of ours (proven live: routing asserted by which module
  answered).
- **The planner is a module invoker.** plan/refine/chat route through the installed module
  (`config.mode`), provider dispatch left core, and `planner-catalog.ts` plus the hardcoded
  Anthropic rows in `models.ts` are deleted. Plan/refine responses carry `provider: "module"` +
  `module` (vivijure-local's shape exactly; the shared panel stays byte-identical).
- **`POST /api/chat` text path routes through the plan.enhance module** and fails honestly when no
  planning module is installed. Its image path and the rest of MODELS are unchanged (cf#129 tracks
  that catalog).
- **Panel stops inventing core-owned values.** The quality-tier fallback (which had ALREADY drifted
  from what core serves) and five hardcoded tier literals are gone; stale saved models/tiers now
  drop visibly with an honest message instead of blanking or silently persisting invented state.
- **Restore paths hardened.** Saved model/tier restores go through one guarded pending-value
  mechanism; two live-found defects (post-load stale id leaving the picker blank+silent; tier
  control blanking on stale tier) fixed and re-verified live.
- **Dev: modbound scenario harness** (`SCENARIO=default|empty|thirdparty|staleid`, `DRY_RUN=1`) for
  gate runs against real module absence; planner AI mock moved into the module (its dev wiring fix
  rode #134); teardown runbook documents the orphaned-worker hazard.
- Parity gate: cf and local panels verified functionally identical live in a browser, both hosts,
  per-surface evidence; local synced via vivijure-local#102.

## v1.3.1 -- 2026-07-18

**The v1.3.0 release artifact never published; this is the tag that ships it.** PATCH: a build-script
import fix plus the CI guard that makes this class fail on a PR instead of on a tag.

- **v1.3.0 built nothing.** The tag fired, the studio deployed (inert), the D1 migrate was a no-op --
  and then the release-artifact job died in 14 seconds with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND`. Nothing reached
  the GitHub release or the R2 mirror. The v1.3.0 tag is left exactly where it is; tags never move.
- **The cause.** `scripts/build-studio-release.ts` imported
  `../src/platform/orchestrator-vars.js`. The release workflow runs it as
  `node scripts/build-studio-release.ts`, and Node type-stripping does not rewrite relative
  specifiers: the literal `.js` path must exist on disk, and only the `.ts` does. Fixed by importing
  the `.ts` extension directly.
- **Why every gate said green.** `tsc --noEmit` accepts the `.js` specifier because
  `moduleResolution` is `bundler`, which maps it to the `.ts` source. The test suite never executed
  the script. And the pre-merge end-to-end run of the builder went through a resolver that also maps
  `.js` to `.ts`, rather than the bare `node` the workflow actually uses. Three green signals, one
  dead runtime, and the only place it could surface was a tag.
- **The guard: `tests/release-builder-runs.test.ts`.** It invokes the builder under bare `node` and
  asserts it reaches its own `missing --bundle` argument check, which proves the whole import graph
  resolved. About a second, no wrangler bundle required, and it runs in normal CI -- so a broken
  release builder now fails on the pull request. It carries a positive control, so it cannot pass by
  the script dying earlier for an unrelated reason.
- **CONSUMER NOTE, the `vivijure-control-plane` pin floor is v1.3.1, not v1.3.0.** v1.3.0 exists as a
  tag but published no artifact, so a floor pointing at it would resolve to an empty mirror slot:
  it would fail honestly, but confusingly. The manifest shape is unchanged from what v1.3.0
  described (`migrations` + `required_vars`); only the tag that actually carries it has moved on.

## v1.3.0 -- 2026-07-18

**The studio release artifact carries its own schema and its own env contract (cf#85).** MINOR: a new
manifest capability, added so the hosted control plane can be extracted into its own repository
without reaching back into this one.

- **`manifest.json` gains `migrations` and `required_vars`.** The release artifact now ships the
  tenant D1 schema (every top-level `migrations/*.sql`, in apply order, each with its own `sha256`
  and `size`) and the studio env var contract (`ORCHESTRATOR_VAR_KEYS`, projected at build time).
  `studio-release.yml` uploads `migrations/` to the R2 release mirror alongside `worker.js` and
  `assets/`.
- **Why: the hosted control plane was reaching into this repo at build time.** It imported
  `../../migrations/*.sql` and `ORCHESTRATOR_VAR_KEYS` directly. The extraction contract (cf#85)
  forbids source-level imports across the repo seam, since the control plane consumes the studio ONLY
  as a published artifact, so the two things it legitimately needs had to move INTO the artifact.
  Copying them into the new repo was rejected: a copy plus a guard test that validates the copy is a
  drift factory with a green light on it, and drift in exactly these two lists is what caused two
  live provision failures.
- **This closes the versioning caveat that `studio-migrations.ts` documented against itself.** The
  migrations used to ride the CONTROL PLANE deploy commit while the worker was a pinned RELEASE, so
  a tenant could get its schema from one version of the studio and its worker from another. Tenant
  schema and tenant worker now come from ONE pinned artifact and that skew cannot exist.
- **Migrations are named, not content-addressed.** The runner records each by FILENAME in the tenant
  `schema_migrations` table, so the name is load-bearing state rather than a label.
- **The builder refuses a zero-migration set.** A silent empty set would give every new tenant a
  blank D1 and report success, the worst failure mode available. Both refusal paths (empty directory,
  missing `--migrations`) are negative-tested with a positive control on the same command.
- **`ORCHESTRATOR_VAR_KEYS` moved to a leaf module** (`src/platform/orchestrator-vars.ts`, zero
  imports); `cf-platform.ts` re-exports it, so every consumer is unchanged and there is still exactly
  ONE source of truth. It is a leaf because the consumer is a plain node build script, which has no
  business dragging the Worker runtime graph (Env, presigner, secret store, module transport, R2
  store) in behind a list of strings.
- **CONSUMER NOTE, the `vivijure-control-plane` pin floor is v1.3.0.** The extracted control plane
  reads migrations and the bind census from the pinned bundle and FAILS LOUD below this tag, with no
  baked-in fallback. `tests/release-manifest-contract.test.ts` guards the shape: the manifest is now
  an interface consumed by another repository, so removing a field is a breaking change.
- **Test-side fix (cf#107).** `orch()` in `tests/orchestrator-env.ts` attached `PRESIGNER` and then
  declared its return type as plain `T`, discarding the type it had just added. Invisible because
  `tsconfig` never typechecked `tests/` and vitest transpiles without checking. Type-level only; no
  behaviour change.

## v1.2.6 -- 2026-07-18

**The tenant studio gets the env its own code requires (#116).** PATCH: the fifth and last defect of
the "a value known at provision time never reaches one of its consumers" family.

- **`R2_S3_ENDPOINT` is bound on the tenant studio (cf#116).** `r2-presign.ts` requires all four of
  `R2_S3_{ACCESS_KEY_ID,SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,ENDPOINT,BUCKET}` and throws without them. Three were
  bound. So a tenant provisioned 9/9 green, came up live, rendered its keyframe (a real 1MB PNG,
  in R2), and then threw inside the keyframe -> clips handoff on EVERY poll, forever, surfacing as an
  opaque 500. Deterministic, no race. The value is an identifier, not a credential: constructed as
  `https://<account>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com`, the same endpoint already handed to the RunPod
  templates.
- **Parity break, not just a missing var.** Self-host derives `R2_S3_ENDPOINT` from
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` at deploy, so a self-hosted studio could presign and a hosted tenant could
  not, on identical code.
- **All 18 platform vars now carry a deliberate disposition.** `tenant-studio-env.ts` records, for
  every key in the studio's `ORCHESTRATOR_VAR_KEYS`, whether it is `provisioned`, `conditional`,
  `default` (deliberately absent, with the safe behaviour named), or `not-hosted` -- each with its
  reason, verified against the reading code rather than guessed from the name. Three "absent is
  fine" claims were checked directly: `ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED` allows only on the literal `"true"`
  (absent = deny), `SPEND_LIMIT_FAIL_CLOSED` is `!== "false"` (absent = fail-closed), and
  `FILM_CLIP_DURATION_FLOOR` falls back to the core default.
- **The two lists are now linked in CI.** The studio's contract and the provisioner's bindings were
  hand-maintained separately with nothing connecting them, which is the actual defect class: they
  drifted silently and surfaced only at a first render. A gate now asserts the disposition map is
  exhaustive in BOTH directions against `ORCHESTRATOR_VAR_KEYS`, and that every `provisioned` var
  appears in the RECORDED UPLOAD rather than merely in a source array.
- **The verify census covers the contract.** It previously checked a remembered subset, which is why
  provisioning reported green over a studio that could not presign: a var nobody listed is a var
  nobody checks.

## v1.2.4 -- 2026-07-18

**Provisioning survives its own execution budget (#112).** PATCH: a provision no longer has to fit in
one invocation, and a lost driver can no longer strand a tenant forever.

- **Poll-driven continuation (cf#112).** A provision job ran under a single `waitUntil`, whose
  extension window is on the order of 30 seconds. Run 4 of the cf#99 finale spent ~22 of those
  seconds before the module install even began; the runtime then cancelled the invocation mid-step.
  Nothing wrote a terminal state, because the `catch` that writes one only runs if the function is
  still running, so the job row said `running` forever and the tenant sat at `provisioning` with no
  error and no retry path. `runProvisionJob` now works until a per-invocation budget (15s) is spent,
  persists progress, and YIELDS. The poll route drives any unfinished job forward under its own fresh
  invocation, so the client's normal polling cadence walks the provision to completion. Shortening
  individual waits was rejected as a fix: it buys headroom, not correctness, and the next slow step
  puts us back in the same hole.
- **A yield is not a failure.** Progress is persisted and the job stays `running` with no error;
  only a real fault writes a terminal failure.
- **Continuation is bounded by credential custody, deliberately.** Key A is transient by design and a
  poll-driven driver does not have it, so continuation can only complete a job that already reached
  the studio upload (it needs just `endpoints_json` and the encrypted studio token). A job interrupted
  earlier now fails honestly telling the tenant to provision again, rather than waiting forever for a
  driver that could never succeed.
- **Lease-guarded, because polls overlap.** Several polls are in flight at once; without arbitration
  each would start its own driver and two drivers would double-mint credentials. `claimJob` is a
  conditional UPDATE, so exactly one poll wins and the rest do nothing. The lease also stopped being
  pushed 10 minutes into the future on every step, which under continuation would have kept a dead
  job un-drivable for ten minutes -- the same bug wearing a lease.
- **Lost invocations are declared, not tolerated.** A non-terminal job with no progress for over ten
  minutes is marked `failed` with `invocation lost: no progress for over 10 minutes`. An eternal
  spinner is a lie of omission: the tenant can neither wait it out nor retry.
- **Every studio dispatch is time-bounded.** `AbortSignal.timeout` on `callTenantStudio` (probe and
  installs alike): bounding a retry loop does nothing if one request inside it can hang forever.
  The module-install probe deadline drops from 60s to 15s, sized against the invocation budget it
  actually runs in rather than against wall-clock optimism.

## v1.2.3 -- 2026-07-18

**Provision survives an adopted RunPod template (#83).** PATCH: the third and last adopt-path defect
the hosted-tier finale surfaced. An adopted tenant now renders instead of dying on R2 auth.

- **Adopted templates get the freshly minted R2 credential (cf#83).** `createTenantEndpoints` is
  idempotent-by-name, but an adopted ENDPOINT short-circuited the whole iteration and an adopted
  TEMPLATE was reused as-is, so the newly minted R2 credential only ever reached a template we
  CREATED. Every provision mints a new bucket-scoped credential, so an adopted tenant provisioned
  green (9/9 steps) and then died at its first render with
  `botocore ClientError (401) HeadObject: Unauthorized`, because the container was authenticating
  with the credential baked in on an earlier run. The template is now refreshed via
  `PATCH /templates/{id}` on every provision, BEFORE the endpoint is touched, so the fresh credential
  reaches every consumer before anything can invalidate the old one.
- **An endpoint with no matching template is now a refusal, not a silent pass.** That is the one
  shape where the minted credential has nowhere to go; reporting the endpoint as ready would be the
  same lie in a new costume, so it fails loudly instead.
- **The env asymmetry survives the refresh path.** The backend reads `R2_ENDPOINT` +
  `HF_HUB_OFFLINE`, satellites read `R2_ENDPOINT_URL` (finding F17). Getting that wrong on refresh
  would only surface at a tenant first render, so it is asserted directly.
- **Gated by a state-reading test, not a call-counting one.**
  `tests/control-plane/adopted-template-cred.test.ts` uses a RunPod fake that STORES template env and
  asserts the adopted template OBJECT ends up carrying the minted credential. Asserting that an
  updater was called would pass against an updater that wrote nothing, which is the stub class that
  let this ship broken. Mutation-checked: skipping the refresh reproduces the live stale-credential
  shape (`expected 'STALE_AK_revoked' to be 'FRESH_AK_minted_this_run'`).

## v1.2.2 -- 2026-07-18

**Provision survives an adopted studio script (#108).** PATCH: the second adopt-path defect the
hosted-tier finale surfaced. `modules_install` no longer races the token it just uploaded.

- **`modules_install` waits for the studio to actually serve the new token (cf#108).** The
  provisioner mints a fresh `STUDIO_API_TOKEN`, rides it into the tenant studio upload as a
  `secret_text` binding, then immediately drives that studio for each module. The studio script name
  is slug-based, so a re-provision ADOPTS the existing script object, and the edge can still be
  serving the PREVIOUS version, which carries the PREVIOUS token. The install 403d and the whole
  provision failed at step 7 of 8. A brand-new script has no previous version, which is why the
  earlier fresh-slug run passed this step and the first adopt run did not. There is now a bounded
  pre-install liveness probe: one authenticated read, retried with backoff until the studio answers
  200 or a 60s deadline expires, run once before the per-module loop.
- **The retry cannot launder a bad credential.** 403 is retryable ONLY inside the probe window,
  because 403 is exactly what a stale serving version looks like. Any non-403 fails immediately
  rather than burning the window on a real error. A genuinely wrong token exhausts the deadline and
  fails loudly with attempt count and elapsed time. Per-module installs stay single-attempt: the
  probe did not turn the install loop into a retry loop.
- **Gated by test, including the negative half.** `tests/control-plane/studio-token-probe.test.ts`
  models a stale version that rejects every path, not just the probe. Mutation-checked twice:
  removing the probe reproduces the live `install keyframe (...) -> 403: {"error":"bad API token"}`,
  and making the probe succeed on exhaustion instead of failing turns the negative tests red.
- **Recorded on #108: `modified_on` is not a freshness signal.** On a Workers-for-Platforms
  dispatch-namespace script it tracks creation and matches the namespace `created_on`; it does not
  move on re-upload. It nearly produced a wrong diagnosis here. Check bindings, or another
  content-derived fact, to decide whether an upload landed.

## v1.2.1 -- 2026-07-18

**Provision survives an adopted D1 (#105).** PATCH: the hosted-tier finale hit a hard failure on
the first provision that adopted an EXISTING tenant database; `d1_migrate` is now tracked rather
than replayed.

- **`d1_migrate` no longer replays every migration (cf#105).** `d1_create` is adopt-on-exists, but
  the migration step applied the whole bundled set unconditionally, on the stated assumption that
  the files are all `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` and therefore safe to re-run. That assumption was
  false: four of the ten bundled migrations are `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`, which SQLite has no
  `IF NOT EXISTS` form for. Provisioning against an already-migrated database failed at step 2 of 7
  with `duplicate column name: voice_id: SQLITE_ERROR`, deterministically, blocking every retry and
  re-provision. The tenant D1 now carries a `schema_migrations` table and the runner applies only
  what is missing, recording each migration by filename as it goes.
- **Adopted pre-tracking databases are reconciled, not re-migrated.** If the tracking table is
  absent or empty but the database already carries studio tables (structural probe on
  `cast_members`, created in `0001_init.sql`), the full bundled set is seeded as applied and
  nothing is run. KNOWN LIMITATION, stated rather than hidden: a database sitting at an OLDER
  migration level than the current release is mis-seeded as current. Acceptable today because every
  adoptable database is at the current level, and self-healing for all future migrations now that
  tracking exists. Tracked on #105 / #84.
- **Replay safety is now gated by test.** `tests/control-plane/migrate.test.ts` runs the REAL
  shipped migration set through a D1 fake that refuses a duplicate `ADD COLUMN` exactly as SQLite
  does, including a control assertion that the fake can actually fail. Mutation-checked: with the
  skip-check removed the gate reproduces the live `duplicate column name: voice_id` error. The old
  step-machine tests faked `queryD1` as a no-op, which is why they proved ordering and custody but
  never replay safety.

## v1.2.0 -- 2026-07-18

**The hosted render bridge (#99).** MINOR: the last gap from the hosted-tier e2e burn -- a
provisioned tenant now comes up with working render modules, not an empty catalog.

- **Tenant render-module provisioning (cf#99): the studio-to-endpoint bridge.** A provisioned
  tenant came up live but with ZERO render modules (`/api/modules/installed` empty, renders
  503'd): the spec built the studio and the GPU endpoints but not the module workers that read
  the endpoint ids. The provisioner now, per tenant, uploads tenant-configured copies of the
  module workers (`keyframe`, `own-gpu`, `finish-upscale`, `finish-lipsync`, `speech-upscale`)
  into a shared `TENANT_MODULE_NAMESPACE` (tenant-id-prefixed script names), binds
  `MODULE_DISPATCH` on the tenant studio (upload metadata only -- the studio bundle stays
  byte-identical to self-host), and installs each through the studio's OWN conformance-gated
  `/api/modules/install` route. Key B lands on the studio + every module script in
  `installInvokeKey`. Teardown prefix-sweeps the module scripts and censuses zero remain. Module
  bundles ship in the SAME release artifact (`studio-releases/<tag>/modules/<name>/`), built by
  `scripts/build-module-release.ts` and fetched + integrity-checked by `r2ModuleBundleSource`.
  New required var: `TENANT_MODULE_NAMESPACE` (provisioner-created if missing).

## v1.1.0 -- 2026-07-17

**The hosted-tier train lands (#63-#82).** MINOR: hosted control plane, studio release
pipeline, provisioner wiring. This is the first tag intended to produce a published studio
release artifact (the v1.0.0 GitHub release carries no assets and predates the #77/#78/#79
asset fixes).

- **Hosted control-plane worker** (`wrangler.control-plane.toml`): accounts + magic-link
  sign-in, AUP acceptance gate at signup, and the tenant provisioner over Workers for
  Platforms dispatch (per-tenant D1, R2 bucket, RunPod endpoints). With no studio release
  pinned or no provisioner token configured, provisioning refuses honestly with a 503
  before writing any rows.
- **Studio release pipeline** (`.github/workflows/studio-release.yml`): a `v*` tag builds
  the per-tag tenant studio artifact, attaches it to the GitHub release, and mirrors it to
  the R2 release bucket with a tag + sha256 manifest. The manifest carries `assets_config`
  so tenants get the tested asset shape (#78); `run_worker_first` is set so tenant
  hostnames never fall through to static assets (#77); tenants get the release's own
  asset handling (#79).
- **Provisioner wiring (#82):** `runProvisionJob` dispatched via `waitUntil`; real
  invoke-key install via per-script secrets; provisioning exempt from the signups gate;
  production `StudioBundleSource` reads the R2 release mirror; migrations ship as wrangler
  Text modules with a disk-parity guard.
- **Container revert:** module containers back on py3.11 (#71).
- **Installer default:** `UPSCALE_IMAGE_TAG` `1.0.0` → `1.0.1` (matches vivijure-upscale v1.0.1 GHCR). Live RunPod endpoint retag remains operator-opt-in / spend-gated.
- **deploy:** bump installer `*_IMAGE_TAG` defaults to the current promoted constellation
  line (`BACKEND_IMAGE_TAG` `1.0.2`; upscale / musetalk / audio-upscale `1.0.0`). Live RunPod retag
  remains operator-opt-in (no spend from this bump). Closes #41.

## v1.0.0 -- 2026-07-16

**Vivijure Cloudflare host leaves pre-1.0.** Aligns the CF control panel with the constellation
stable line (vivijure / doors / finish modules at v1.0.0).

- **Homelab MCP wrangler:** `wrangler.mcp.flatliners.toml` -> `wrangler.mcp.propagandhi.toml`.
  Custom domain is `studio-mcp-propagandhi.skyphusion.org` (`studio-mcp-flatliners` dropped).
  Cloudflare Worker *script* name stays `vivijure-studio-mcp-flatliners` until a deliberate rename
  migration (non-destructive).
- Includes all v0.21.x fleet restore and media-container fixes shipped on main since the last tag.

## v0.21.4 -- 2026-07-15

- **Restore the module fleet to IaC: re-vendor all 25 `modules/*/wrangler.toml` and turn
  `CORE_ONLY_DEPLOY` off.** The #774 studio move carried module SOURCE into this repo but not the
  deploy configs, so the fleet was orphaned from CI and last shipped by hand (2026-07-13). The
  authoritative tomls are restored from the pre-split history (placeholder store/service ids, injected
  in CI from repo vars/secrets exactly like the core), so a tag now deploys the whole fleet + core
  from source with no manual `wrangler deploy`. `CORE_ONLY_DEPLOY` is kept as an opt-in core-only
  safety valve but defaults off. Nothing is hand-deployed unless it genuinely cannot be IaC'd.
- **`local-gpu` v0.1.2 honors the active door's declared duration grid at submit time.** A fixed-grid
  door now supplies both `fps` and the selected tier's frame count instead of inheriting
  `seconds * fps` from the shared module defaults. This prevents CogVideoX-5B-I2V from accepting
  off-grid 25/41-frame jobs that report success but decode as latent tile noise. Flexible LTX doors
  omit `duration_grid` and retain the existing duration-derived behavior. This release is what ships
  it live (the module worker deploys via the restored fleet pipeline above).

## v0.21.3 -- 2026-07-13

**Bump `@skyphusion-labs/vivijure-core` to `^0.9.5`: the #29 advance-lease idempotency fix.** PATCH.

- **#29 (film-advance lease is now idempotent under retry).** The core lease (migration 0007) stored only
  `advance_lease`, the winner's expiry (unix ms) -- NOT a unique leaseholder identity. On Cloudflare
  `Date.now()` is coarsened + frozen per-invocation, so two drivers racing in the same millisecond compute
  the identical expiry; that made `claimFilmAdvance` non-idempotent under `withD1Retry`: a committed-but-lost
  UPDATE response, when retried, no longer matched the `advance_lease < now` predicate (the lease is now
  future), so the true holder wrongly read `{ won: false }` and wedged the film up to a full TTL (300s).
  Core `^0.9.5` writes a per-claim UUID into a new `advance_lease_token` column (generated ONCE, so every
  retry re-binds the same token) and adds `OR advance_lease_token = ?` to the claim predicate: a
  lost-response retry matches its own committed token (a real win, no stall), a same-ms loser carries a
  different token (correctly loses), and release clears by token (a stale release can never free another
  driver's live lease).
- **Migration 0011 (`0011_advance_lease_token.sql`).** Additive-only (`ALTER TABLE renders ADD COLUMN
  advance_lease_token TEXT`) -> rides the normal auto-apply, applied before the core deploy so the column
  exists when the `^0.9.5` code references it. Backward compatible: NULL = unleased / a legacy row; a fresh
  UUID never equals NULL.

- **Core-only deploy switch (`CORE_ONLY_DEPLOY`).** vivijure-cf is the stripped host on the PUBLISHED
  core: it owns the core worker + registry wiring, and the module workers are deployed and managed
  independently (they stay live and are bound by service name). The tag-deploy module step now honours a
  `CORE_ONLY_DEPLOY=1` repo variable: when set it deploys the core worker only (+ applies D1 migrations),
  skipping the module fleet with an explicit log (and a loud drift warning if module configs are present
  anyway). Unset preserves the full monolith-style co-deploy. This lets a core-only change (like this #29
  bump) ship without redeploying 25 live module workers.

**Retire the `text-overlay` finish module (dead code; superseded by `subtitle` + `film-titles`).** PATCH.

- **`text-overlay` retired, not fixed.** The module read its content from `req.config.overlays` (an
  array), but `overlays` was never a declared `config_schema` field (schema types are only int / float /
  bool / enum / string; there is no array type). The core `validateConfig` (`src/modules/registry.ts`)
  builds a module's validated config ONLY from declared schema keys, so `overlays` was always stripped
  before the module saw it: it could never receive overlay content through any path (config or derived),
  and always took the clean no-overlays passthrough. Captions and title / credit cards are already covered
  by the working, output-verified `subtitle` and `film-titles` modules. Removed: the
  `modules/text-overlay/` worker, its `MODULE_TEXT_OVERLAY` service binding in `wrangler.toml.example`,
  the CI + deploy-doc references, and `tests/text-overlay.test.ts`. The `film-orchestrator` chain-advance
  fixtures that used it as a generic unmodeled finish step now use a neutral `MODULE_FINISH_STUB`. The
  core auto-discovers modules via the `MODULE_*` service-binding scan, so dropping the binding delists it
  after the next core deploy.

**Delist `alibaba-wan-lora` from the v1.0 distribution (unverified, not retired).** PATCH.

- **`alibaba-wan-lora` delisted pending verification (#771).** Its distinguishing feature -- injecting
  custom operator LoRAs into the Wan 2.2 cloud i2v path (`high_noise_loras` / `low_noise_loras`) -- is
  UNVERIFIED: exercising it needs a hosted Wan2.2 i2v LoRA artifact, and the cast LoRAs on hand are SDXL
  keyframe LoRAs (wrong architecture), so a render with empty LoRA arrays only duplicates the already
  output-verified `alibaba-wan` backend. Rather than ship an advertised-but-unverified feature in v1.0, the
  module is DELISTED, not retired: the `MODULE_ALIBABA_WAN_LORA` core binding is commented in
  `wrangler.toml.example`, the module DIR is added to the CI deploy-loop `EXCLUDE`, and it is dropped from
  `deploy.sh` `STANDARD_MODULES`. The module SOURCE and its tests stay intact; re-enable the binding + drop
  it from `EXCLUDE` once the custom-LoRA path is output-verified with a real Wan LoRA.

## v0.21.2

**Stop the full-film route from retraining already-ready cast LoRAs, and record the honest quality tier (#762).** PATCH.

- **#762 (Bug 1, the LoRA-retrain regression):** the full-film submit route (`hStartFilm`) resolved a
  ready cast's banked adapters (`resolveCastLoras` -> `pretrained`) but then **dropped `pretrained_loras`**
  when handing off to `startFilmJob`, forwarding only `cast_loras` (the write-back ids). The GPU worker
  therefore got no adapter to reuse and **retrained each LoRA from scratch** -- the ~20-minute, no-signal
  inline retrain the storyboard/scatter routes were already fixed against, but the film route never was
  (hit live 2026-07-12: a film with two `lora_status: ready` characters sat 23 min "in keyframe"
  retraining them). The film route now forwards `pretrained_loras` exactly like `hSubmitRender`, so the
  worker reuses the banked adapter. A regression test now asserts every submit path forwards
  `pretrained_loras` for a ready cast, so this class cannot silently regress again.
- **#762 (Bug 2, tier row-label honesty):** `filmRowFromJob` hardcoded `qualityTier: "final"`, so a draft
  film was mislabeled `final` in the renders-history row. The ACTUAL render already honored the requested
  tier via the baked `keyframe_config.quality_tier` + `motion_config` (the hardcode never reached the
  GPU), but the recorded row lied. `hStartFilm` now reads an optional top-level `qualityTier`, threads it
  onto the job, and `filmRowFromJob` records `job.quality_tier` (defaulting `final` when absent).
  Documented in `docs/CONTRACT.md` 2.20; slate wires its film submit to send the field separately.

## v0.21.1

**Fix a bundle-key collision that corrupted concurrent same-title renders (#759).** PATCH.

- **#759:** `assembleBundle` derived the bundle R2 key from the project title alone
  (`bundles/<projectName>.tar.gz`), so two renders sharing a title -- trivially the default "Untitled",
  or the same project rendered twice concurrently -- resolved to the **same key** and overwrote each
  other's tarball mid-render, corrupting whichever render read the bundle after the other's PUT (hit
  live 2026-07-12: two slate films, both "Untitled", both pointing at `bundles/Untitled.tar.gz`). The
  key is now content-addressed -- `bundles/<projectName>-<sha256(tar)[:16]>.tar.gz` -- so distinct
  bundles never collide, while a byte-identical re-render still dedupes to the same key (idempotent).
  Same content-addressed pattern already used for the `cast-clean/<sha256>` portraits. The returned
  key is persisted on the job, so all downstream reads are unaffected; no API/contract change.

## v0.21.0

**Cancel any in-flight render from the history list (#757).** MINOR (new planner capability, additive).

- **#757:** the render-history list now shows a **cancel** button on every non-terminal row
  (`IN_QUEUE` / `IN_PROGRESS` / `SUBMITTED` / `SCATTERING`), wired to the existing
  `DELETE /api/storyboard/render/:jobId` route. Previously the only cancel control was the render
  panel's own button, which appears solely for a render the panel itself launched -- so a render
  started out-of-band (the slate bot, a direct API call, the Studio MCP) was in-flight and burning GPU
  with no way to stop it from the UI (found live 2026-07-12: two slate renders had to be cancelled by
  hand via curl). Now if a job is visible on the list, it can be cancelled there, whoever launched it.
  Terminal rows never show the button; on a readonly/demo deploy the mutation fetch shim blocks the
  `DELETE`, so no extra gate is needed. No backend change -- pure frontend over routes that already
  existed.

## v0.20.3

**The S40 tail: surface the real per-shot error on a zero-clip film.** PATCH (fix-class, no new
features, contract unchanged). Ships the #755 fix that was merged after the v0.20.2 train.

- **#754 (PR #755):** when every clip failed, a film died with the bare generic "no clips rendered to
  assemble", discarding the per-shot reasons already on `clipJob.shots[].error`. A door / backend's
  real error (e.g. the clip-upload `Unauthorized` behind `vivijure-local-12gb#99`) never reached the
  operator, turning a config issue into a long hunt. New pure `describeClipFailures(job)` aggregates
  each failed shot's `shot_id: <reason>` so the zero-clip failure now reads "no clips rendered to
  assemble -- shot_01: <real error>; ...", falling back to "unknown error" for a reasonless shot and
  to the bare generic when nothing failed with a reason. Honest-failure doctrine (#245/#249): a
  failure must name WHY. The rarer post-finish "no clips to assemble" site (no per-shot job in scope)
  is left as a follow-up.

## v0.20.2

**The S40 total-shakedown fix batch.** PATCH (all fix-class; every documented feature, knob, error
path, and event was exercised live against prod and the doors, and every divergence from the
S39-truthed docs was fixed). No new features; the contract is unchanged except where a route was made
MORE honest.

Honest-failure fixes (the #245/#249 doctrine, pushed to every path):
- **#738 (PR #742):** `POST /api/render/film` now `400`s a bound-but-untrained `cast_loras` (the
  untrained-cast message), symmetric with `/api/storyboard/render` -- it no longer silently dropped
  the binding and shipped generic characters. This is the direct-API + Slate bot path.
- **#739 (PR #745):** `castLoras` is now OPTIONAL on the scatter path (absent/empty -> generic
  shards, like the film/render siblings); the old hard "castLoras required for scatter" was unintended
  coupling from the v0.2.0 bulk ship. A PRESENT-but-untrained binding still `400`s, so the relax never
  reopens the silent-drop class.
- **#751 (PR #752):** the #707 preflight clamp warning now ESCALATES to a submit-blocking `error` when
  the clamp would land below the `FILM_CLIP_DURATION_FLOOR` gate (a guaranteed hard-fail), instead of
  telling the user the render is "unblocked". A within-floor clamp stays a warning.

Correctness / honesty-in-errors:
- **#731 (PR #734):** `/api/storyboard/yaml` and `/api/storyboard/markers` return `400` on bad input
  instead of `500` (yaml validated a raw storyboard before serializing; markers checks its format enum).
- **#737:** `/api/upload` returns `size` (was `bytes`), matching its two sibling upload routes and
  CONTRACT 2.10; plus four stale CONTRACT lines trued up (UUID ids, renders default limit 50, fixed
  `whoami`).
- **#740 (PR #741):** the planner project picker now syncs to the active project after a create (was
  stuck on "(no project)").
- **#743 (PR #744):** the YAML preview tab is no longer blank after plan/refine (fetches the preview
  the same way scene-edit does, and the dead `data.yaml` read is gone).

Docs-truth (fixes to what the contract claimed, not behavior):
- **#730 (PR #736):** the `bundle_key` path-format guard is now documented in CONTRACT 2.18/2.20/2.23;
  the #696 config-map array message reads "not an array".
- **#746 (PR #748):** the `quality_tiers` blurbs are scoped to the reference cloud backend (the frame
  counts are backend-specific; delivered truth is always `clip_deliveries`).

Deploy / infra:
- **#686 (PR #747):** `down --delete-data` now empties a non-empty R2 bucket (paginated) before
  deleting it, so a teardown of an install that actually rendered no longer dies at the bucket step.
- **#725 (PR #733), #726 (PR #732), #657 (PR #735):** stale `constellation.sh` profile comments fixed;
  dead `EMAIL` binding removed; the Python installer's media-provisioning path documented.
- **#729:** the straggler path-scoped Cloudflare Access app on `/health` (created after the v0.12.0
  Access drop) was deleted; `/health` is public again, matching CONTRACT 2.2 and SECURITY.md.

Banked for post-shakedown (filed, not in this release): #749 (deploy/ pytest not gated in CI), #750
(demo `render.available` is a config flag, not a door healthcheck). Backend pin alignment to `0.4.9`
(#728) shipped in `vivijure-backend` (PR #251).

Release-prep files: package.json, CHANGELOG.md (the code landed in PRs #732/#733/#734/#735/#736/#737/
#741/#742/#744/#745/#747/#748/#752, already on `main`).

## v0.20.1

**Clip polls tolerate transient errors (#719, PR #720).** PATCH (fix class). The standing-door
verify killed a healthy render at ~2min: the local door's `/status` stalls up to ~5s mid-sampler-step
(GIL hold under model offload), one poll landed in the stall, and `applyPoll` stickily failed the
shot on that single transport blip. The finish chain has had the right contract since #141; the clip
poll now gets it: `classifyTransientFailure` (the shared transient-vs-deterministic classifier;
`classifyFinishFailure` delegates to it) + a `CLIP_POLL_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3) CONSECUTIVE-blip budget --
a transient error holds the shot pending, a healthy round-trip resets the streak, exhaustion fails
loud citing the real error, and a deterministic module-reported reject still fails immediately.
Studio prong of the two-pronged #719 fix; the door-side root cause (sub-second `/status` under
render load) ships in vivijure-local-16gb v0.3.2 / -12gb v0.4.2.

Files: package.json, CHANGELOG.md, src/render-orchestrator.ts, src/film-model.ts,
tests/render-orchestrator.test.ts.

## v0.20.0

**The S37 fix queue: the S36 e2e findings landed.** MINOR (new features: duration honesty
surfacing + the duration-grid contract field). Everything follows the honest-failures doctrine.

- The 90min hard ceiling tracks real progress on per-shot phases (#704, PR #708): clips/speech/
  finish measure `PHASE_HARD_DEADLINE_SECONDS` against `last_progress_at` (re-stamped on every
  finished shot, #136) instead of `phase_started_at`, so a slow local-gpu card landing one clip
  every few minutes never hard-fails a healthy big film mid-progress, while 90min since the LAST
  landed shot still fails loud. The batch keyframe phase keeps phase-age semantics.
- The `distilled` tier-honesty flag flows end to end (#705, PRs #710 + #712): the local-gpu module
  passes the backend's `distilled` through (thanks @skyphusion-albini), the canonical contract
  carries it (`MotionBackendOutput.distilled?`, additive), `applyPoll` retains it per shot, and the
  film summary + poll view surface it. Absence stays absent, never a fabricated false.
- Duration honesty for fixed-grid backends (#707, PRs #709 #711 #713 #715 #714; the issue stays
  open for the door-side /health declaration):
  - `clip_deliveries` on the film summary AND the planner poll view: per done shot,
    `planned_seconds` vs `delivered_seconds` (+ fps/frames/distilled), absent until a backend
    reports numbers.
  - Contract: `ModuleManifest.duration_grid` (additive, no MODULE_API bump) -- a fixed-grid
    motion backend's pinned fps + per-tier frame caps; documented in docs/module-api.md.
  - Preflight warns per shot that would be clamped (`motionBackend` + `quality` optional on the
    /api/storyboard/preflight envelope); warning, never a submit-blocking error.
  - The local-gpu module RELAYS a door-declared grid from the door's /health into its manifest
    (best-effort, 1.5s timeout, 5min pos/neg cache so module discovery never hangs on a down door).
  - Panel: per-shot "delivered / planned" honesty line with an amber clamp flag and a
    "(distilled)" marker; preflight re-runs on backend/tier change.

## v0.19.5

**The honesty batch: the four S31 GPU-proof findings fixed.** PATCH (fix class; no new features).
All four were live-hit during the 2026-07-11 v0.19.4 proof renders and every fix follows the
honest-failures doctrine: a degrade is never silent, garbage bounces loud before spend.

- Per-shot duration honesty gate at assemble (#697, PR #700): the video-finish container probes
  each normalized clip's ACTUAL assembled seconds and returns `clipDurations`; the core (single-film
  AND scatter paths) compares each clip against its planned seconds and fails the render LOUD when a
  clip lands below the floor (`FILM_CLIP_DURATION_FLOOR` [vars] knob, default 0.5, clamped [0,1],
  "0" disables) -- a 0.085s clip for a 4s speaking shot can no longer ship as a green film. The gate
  fires on evidence only: an older container reporting no durations logs and no-ops, never a false
  failure. Root cause of the truncation itself (an outlived/retried encode race adopting a partial
  write, the #600 family) is class-proven; the exact site needs satellite job correlation and the
  gate closes the class regardless. NOTE: arms in prod once the media-stack video-finish image rolls.
- Caption cues timed to the ACTUAL cut (#698, PR #700): burn + .srt cue timelines now build from
  the probed per-clip durations (bundle plan only fills unreported shots), so cues track the real
  film on every tier instead of drifting past EOF on standard/draft.
- A started film never 500s (#695, PR #699): post-start bookkeeping (history-row insert,
  download-url presign) is best-effort after `startFilmJob` returns -- a transient D1 timeout logs
  `render.bookkeeping_deferred` and the 201 ships, instead of baiting a retry-on-5xx client into a
  second film. Poll insert-if-missing heals the row. Same window closed in `hSubmitRender` and
  `hRenderFromKeyframes`; polls stay throwing (idempotent).
- Config maps 400 at the door (#696, PR #699): every render/film config map
  (`keyframe_config`/`motion_config` top-level; `finish_config`/`speech_config`/
  `film_finish_config`/`master_config` top-level AND per-module entry, plus `renderOverrides` and
  its per-module config entries) bounces `badRequest` naming the offending (dotted) field when
  present but not a plain JSON object -- a mis-encoded map can no longer clamp to defaults and
  silently degrade a film that completes "done".

## v0.19.4

**The demo-studio first-impression train, folded into a tag, plus two honest-surface fixes.** PATCH
(demo-gated or prod-inert changes; prod runtime behavior is unchanged except where noted).

- Demo studio (all demo-gated, live at demo.vivijure.com since 2026-07-11): real cast portraits
  from the showcase asset host (#688), honest capability catalogs -- a demo serves empty
  planning-model + voice lists instead of advertising backends it cannot invoke (#689), the
  visitor steer panel -- render-a-free-clip scene menu, capped OSS assistant, honest
  queue/cap/paused copy, demo root lands on the planner (#690), and a control-free
  finished-films gallery (#691). Favicons shipped for every studio page (#679).
- Studio MCP: `submit_film` now exposes `speech_config`, `film_finish_config`, and `master_config`
  and forwards them verbatim, so subtitle mode (`burn`/`sidecar`/`both`) and the master-chain knobs
  are reachable from an agent; previously they were silently unreachable via MCP (#674, PR #693).
- `/api/artifact/*` on a deploy with no render bucket bound (the demo) serves an honest 404 with
  steer language instead of throwing a 500 (#646, PR #692). Deploys with the binding are
  byte-identical.

Files: package.json, CHANGELOG.md (release commit; feature files landed in PRs #688-#693)

## v0.19.3

**The installer actually works: nine live-proving findings fixed.** PATCH (deploy tooling only; no
runtime behavior change). The S29 proving pass ran `deploy/vivijure_deploy.py` end-to-end on live
accounts for the first time (free -> teardown -> paid -> teardown) and filed a findings ledger; this
release fixes all of it (PRs #683, #685):

- RunPod provisioning correctness: templates are SERVERLESS (#677 -- endpoint create could never
  succeed before), each satellite endpoint runs its OWN image via a per-endpoint manifest + tag knobs
  and audio-upscale is a first-class endpoint (#678), and the pre-bake network volume is GONE (#676 --
  baked images ship weights in-layer; no more DATACENTER_ID, no DC-pinned workers, no ~$7/mo/endpoint
  dead storage).
- State honesty: every successful create persists to state IMMEDIATELY, and a create that errors
  after server-side success (RunPod's intermittent 500 flake) is recovered by re-list instead of
  orphaning the resource and footgunning the next run (#675). State is bound to the Cloudflare
  account that created it -- a second-account run dies loud instead of silently reusing ids (#684).
- Secret map: the store seed list is the UNION of every secret_name the workers actually bind
  (unit-asserted against the tomls); per-satellite endpoint ids seed under their real names, and
  operator-supplied secrets seed as marked placeholders with a post-install checklist (#658 -- the
  old seed set left the core + satellites failing 10182 at deploy).
- R2 mint-lost heal: a run that died between the R2 token mint and the seed no longer perma-fails
  every later deploy; the installer revokes the stale token and re-mints (#680), tolerating tokens
  already revoked out-of-band.
- `down` is idempotent (#682): state entries clear as resources delete, delete-on-missing is
  already-gone (RunPod 404 OR 500), worker-delete WARNs are gated on API reality (no more 27 false
  "delete failed" on a clean teardown), and the documented `--delete-data` re-run works.
- `--noninteractive` writes the operator token to a 0600 file beside the state file instead of
  printing it into CI logs (#681).

## v0.19.2

**Two follow-up fixes: the renders-list default limit + a soft `.srt` download affordance.** PATCH.

- **`GET /api/storyboard/renders` default limit was unreachable for an absent `?limit` (#670).** The route
  coerced `Number(url.searchParams.get("limit"))` FIRST; an absent param is `null` and `Number(null)` is
  `0` (finite), so the `Number.isFinite` guard passed and `limit=0` flowed through, making the intended
  default dead code for the absent case -- `listRendersForUser` then clamped 0 up to 1, so a headless /
  API / MCP consumer calling without a limit silently got ONE render row and could conclude there was one
  render (the frontend always sends `limit=25`, so zero UI impact). Fix: resolve an absent/empty param to
  the default BEFORE coercing (a garbage string still falls back to the default), and align the two
  mismatched defaults (route 100, function signature 50) on one exported `DEFAULT_RENDERS_LIMIT` (50) so
  they cannot drift again.
- **Soft `.srt` subtitle sidecar surfaced as a download in render history (#669).** After #663 the core
  re-times the subtitle sidecar for the title-card prepend, but it was reachable only by R2 key
  convention. `filmJobToPollView` now carries `film_finish.sidecar_key` on the done output ONLY when a
  sidecar was produced, so it persists on the render row and the history list returns it (absent stays
  absent -- no null noise on legacy rows); the frontend projects it into the action row as a
  "subtitles (.srt)" download next to the film download (registry-projection, no extra fetch). The
  poll-view output shape in `docs/CONTRACT.md` documents `sidecar_key`.

## v0.19.1

**Fix sprint: four adoption / delivery correctness fixes across the render + deploy paths.** PATCH.

- **R2 adoption guarded by object freshness -- reusing a project name can no longer ship stale content
  (#661).** Keyframe/clip adoption matched candidates by (project prefix, shot_id) name only, so reusing
  a project name (the planner always emits `shot_01..NN`) let a prior render's leftover keyframes/clips at
  the identical paths look like a complete set: the pending-poll fast path adopted the stale set on tick
  one, cancelled the live producer (#327), and the film completed silently with wrong content (the
  #245/#249 silent-wrong-delivery class; prod repro film-f7453b84). Adoption candidates are now filtered
  by R2 object age -- any object uploaded before the job's `created_at` is skipped -- in the shared listers
  (`listProjectKeyframes`, `listClipsByShotId`), so every caller (keyframe fast path, stall backstop,
  ceiling path, `listProjectClips`, clip reclaim) inherits it. This-run orphans always upload after the
  job starts, so all legitimate recovery semantics survive.
- **Adopted finish-shot ledger reconciled 1:1 to its chain (#662).** Audit verdict: a bookkeeping
  channel-split, not a skip. A shot counted in `finish.adopted` showed `applied[]` missing exactly the one
  chain-module tag that was ADOPTED (RIFE for a no-dialogue chain, LIPSYNC for a dialogue chain) -- the
  step's RunPod job was GC'd or froze after writing its output, so a later tick recovered it via the #583
  hash-gated adopt path (the transform genuinely ran and is present in the delivered clip; a dialogue shot
  is NOT unsynced). The tag was correctly routed to the `adopted` channel, so reading `applied[]` in
  isolation under-reported by one. Adds a per-step honesty ledger (`FinishShot.ledger`) that reconciles
  1:1 to the chain (a reused step is PRESENT, `reused:true`, never dropped) and logs loud if a done shot
  fails to reconcile, keeping the disjoint applied/adopted channels intact. No silent wrong delivery.
- **Subtitle `.srt` sidecar re-timed for the title-card prepend (#663).** The subtitle module (film.finish
  `ui.order` 5) writes its soft `.srt` sidecar against the pre-card, 0-based assembled film; film-titles
  (`ui.order` 10) then prepends a title card, so every sidecar cue ran early against the final film (the
  burned captions were correct -- they ride the video through the prepend). film-titles now reports the
  prepend as `prepend_seconds` (OPTIONAL + additive on `FilmFinishOutput`, no `MODULE_API` bump; the
  subtitle module is unchanged); after the chain completes the core reads the raw per-step sidecar, shifts
  every cue by that offset, and writes the final `.srt` next to the final film, surfaced on the summary as
  `film_finish.sidecar_key` (previously discoverable only by key convention). The offset is persisted per
  step so it survives cross-tick adoption of the prepending step. The film-titles module needs this tag's
  redeploy to emit `prepend_seconds`.
- **`deploy.py` records adopt provenance and skips adopted resources on `down` (#659).** State entries
  from `up --adopt` carry `adopted: true` (legacy plain-string entries stay treated as created); `down`
  skips adopted CF/RunPod resources by default, with `--include-adopted` to force deletion with a warning.

## v0.19.0

**film.finish survives a single step over budget: async job+poll for the video-finish container
(#602).** MINOR. v0.15.x's #600 made a film.finish CHAIN survivable (per-step deterministic keys +
R2-presence adoption across ticks), but a SINGLE step whose encode alone exceeds one request budget
re-dispatched forever: a synchronous module has no poll token, and its output key never appears
because the encode dies with the request. Three layers, no contract bump: the video-finish container
gains an async mode (`POST /async/{route}` -> 202 + jobId, background ffmpeg, PUT on completion;
`GET /async/status/{jobId}`) with the sync routes unchanged; the film-titles + subtitle modules
(v0.2.0) go async-first, returning the existing generic `{pending, poll}` variant and FALLING BACK to
the sync route on a pre-#602 container; the core's `runFilmFinish` becomes a true submit+poll-per-tick
phase on persisted tokens (`film_finish_polls`/`_attempts`), handling both shapes, threaded through
single-film AND scatter. R2 presence stays authoritative on completion and the #190 fail-safe holds:
a genuinely failed step retries bounded then soft-degrades RECORDED (ships uncarded, never silently,
never failing the render). Core deploys safely ahead of the container: the sync fallback carries prod
until the media stack rolls the new image (#634).

Also in this release (shipped on main since v0.18.1, deploys with this tag):
- **Demo studio Phase A foundation (#625):** `AUTH_MODE=demo` read-only gate (GET/HEAD open to
  everyone, every mutation 403, no credential honored) + `host.readonly` registry projection (#628);
  the frontend read-only gate as a pure projection of that one flag (#629); the registry's ONE
  deliberate demo-mode exception reading seeded `installed_modules` without a dispatch namespace,
  display-only by construction (#630). No effect on any non-demo deploy (pinned by tests).

## v0.18.1

**advanceToClips loud-degrades a partial keyframe set, no silent half-film (#622).** PATCH. The
normal-completion sibling of the v0.17.5 (#619) stall fix. `advanceToClips` failed the film ONLY when
a keyframe module matched none of the requested shots; a PARTIAL set (some matched, some missing)
advanced to clips built from the matched shots alone, silently rebasing every downstream counter to
the smaller total so the film reported a clean `complete` over a half-set -- reachable whenever a
keyframe module honestly returns fewer keyframes than scenes (e.g. a per-shot content refusal). A
partial set is not a schema violation (a module can legitimately complete short), so the fix mirrors
the #619 keyframe-ceiling contract: it now delivers the scenes that rendered but LOUDLY, recording the
drop on the existing `keyframes_incomplete` field ({adopted, expected, dropped}), emitting the
`film.keyframes_incomplete` structured event, and surfacing the degrade on `summarizeFilm` + the poll
view, so the film never reports a clean complete over the rebased total. The all-missing case still
hard-fails loud; the record is guarded so the ceiling-recovery path never double-records. Scope:
only the module-completion path (`advanceToClips`); `startFilmFromKeyframes` (a caller-supplied
keyframe subset = explicit intent) is unchanged. Ships via tag deploy.

## v0.18.0

**Welcome/marketing page moves off the Worker to vivijure.com (#617).** MINOR. The public marketing
landing page (`public/welcome.html`) no longer ships inside the Worker bundle: it used to deploy with
every self-hosted studio, dragging our marketing surface, the Umami analytics inject, and the
`/welcome` CSP special-casing along with it. The storefront now lives solely at `https://vivijure.com/`
(already the richer, canonical marketing site), and `/welcome` (+ `/welcome/`, `/welcome.html`) on the
studio host is now a clean **301 redirect** there for link equity. Removed from the Worker:
`welcome.html`, the `welcomeCsp` / `injectWelcomeUmami` / `WELCOME_PATHS` machinery, and the
`UMAMI_WEBSITE_ID` env, across `src/asset-response.ts`, `src/env.ts`, `wrangler.toml.example`,
`deploy.sh`, CI, and `.dev-modbound`. The response-security chokepoint now streams every body
unchanged (the per-request welcome rewrite was its only body-mutating path). Docs updated (SECURITY,
PRIVACY, legal, deploy-config). Two operational notes: the `/welcome` public Access bypass MUST stay
so the 301 resolves for anonymous visitors, and the post-deploy edge purge still flushes the stale
page on the cutover deploy. Ship via tag deploy to make the redirect live.

## v0.17.5

**Keyframe stall recovery: no more silent half-films (#619).** PATCH. A stale keyframe poll with
only a PARTIAL keyframe set in R2 no longer cancels the still-running keyframe job and advances
with the subset (which shipped a film missing scenes while reporting `complete: true`). The
recovery now mirrors the clips recovery (#143): a partial set below the phase ceiling HOLDS (no
cancel, re-fires each stalled sweep as late keyframes land), a full set advances as before, and
the ceiling delivers what rendered LOUDLY -- new `keyframes_incomplete` job field
({adopted, expected, dropped}), a `film.keyframes_incomplete` structured event, and the degrade
surfaced on every poll view. Found by the S26 exercise render (film-8b47feb1 delivered 2 of 4
scenes as a clean green). PR #620.

## v0.17.4

**Welcome page SEO: canonical storefront defers to vivijure.com (#604).** PATCH. `/welcome` now
declares `rel=canonical` and `og:url` at `https://vivijure.com/`, uses the branded
`vivijure.com/og-image.png` for OG/Twitter cards, adds `twitter:site` / `twitter:creator`
(`@skyphusion`), reciprocal `rel=me` identity links, and footer cross-links to the Skyphusion
property mesh. Static HTML only; no Worker logic or schema changes. Ship via tag deploy to refresh
the bundled assets and run the post-deploy `/welcome` edge purge.

## v0.17.3

**film.finish survives films bigger than one invocation budget (#600).** PATCH. The second S25
exercise find: a 1440p48 film's title/caption passes (~8 min CPU each) exceed any single
invocation budget, and the chain minted a RANDOM output key per attempt -- so the every-minute
cron re-encoded the subtitle pass forever (the #122 presence self-heal could never find a prior
success) and film-374268a2 wedged in assemble. Now each film.finish step writes a DETERMINISTIC
key (`<film>-ff<n>.mp4`) and is HEAD-adopted from R2 on re-entry (adoption recorded in the honest
`adopted` channel, #583 discipline); a persisted per-step dispatch marker (in-flight window
1200s) prevents duplicate encodes while one is still running, since the advance-lease TTL (300s)
expires mid-encode and the claim fails open; a step's `curKey` follows the MODULE's reported
film_key, so a noop (subtitle with no dialogue) threads the real film forward instead of a
never-written key. The chain finalizes only on `complete`; an in-flight stop resumes on the next
tick. Fixes the single-film AND scatter paths; the wedged film self-heals on deploy with no
intervention. Follow-up #602: async job+poll for a single step that alone exceeds the budget
(bounded today by the 90-min phase deadline).

## v0.17.2

**The upscale default reverts to animevideov3; x4plus is opt-in until the handler tiles.** PATCH.
The first S25 exercise render (film-01bfda9c) failed honestly: every shot CUDA-OOM at
MODULE_UPSCALE ("tried to allocate 45.7 GiB"), because the v0.17.0 default flip to
RealESRGAN_x4plus (a natively-4x model the container runs untiled) cannot fit a 48fps rife'd 720p
clip's 4x output on even a 96GB GPU. The default follows the handler's proven memory envelope
(finish-upscale 0.1.3); the photoreal-texture goal of #585 stands and the default re-flips after
vivijure-upscale ships tiled x4plus inference (v0.2.9) and it proves out on a real render.
Validation win worth recording: the failure surfaced END TO END with the real per-shot error (the
#245/#249 honest-failure doctrine), and the dialogue shots demonstrably ran lipsync BEFORE
interpolation (#584's order live in prod) before dying at the innocent-bystander upscale step.

## v0.17.1

**The #583 adoption gate flips: an R2 finish artifact is reused ONLY on a matching provenance
sidecar.** PATCH (the final step of the #583 fix; the write-side shipped in v0.17.0). Both adoption
paths (`adoptFinishStepFromR2` and the reclaim scan) now require the artifact's `<outputKey>.hash`
sidecar to equal the core-computed `finishStepInputHash` for the CURRENT inputs; a missing sidecar
(legacy artifact) or a mismatch (different clip / audio / config -- including a prior film's
abandoned artifact at the shared key, the original #583 race) re-runs the step instead of adopting
stale output. Same-job #141/#166 recovery still adopts (inputs unchanged -> hash matches). Deployed
in order: stamped producers first (musetalk :0.1.4, upscale :0.2.8, backend :0.4.8, all
fresh-worker-verified in prod), core write-side (v0.17.0), then this gate. #583 closed.

## v0.17.0

**Finish provenance write-side ships, and the last two S23 showcase finds are fixed.** MINOR (the
module contract gains an additive field, and the #583 provenance machinery is new surface).

- **Core-computed provenance hash + producer-stamped sidecar (#583, steps 2-3).** The core computes
  `finishStepInputHash(clipEtag, audioEtag, config)` at invoke time (ONE exported symbol, golden-
  vectored in CONTRACT.md 3.3.1) and passes the opaque value as `FinishInput.output_hash`; the
  producer containers (musetalk :0.1.4, upscale :0.2.8, backend :0.4.8) write it verbatim to the
  `<outputKey>.hash` sidecar, artifact FIRST, sidecar LAST. Write-side only: the adoption GATE
  (require a matching sidecar before reusing an R2 artifact) flips in the next release, after the
  stamped producers are verified in prod (correctness order: producers first, then the gate).
- **Dialogue shots lip-sync the native-fps clip (#584).** A finish module may declare the additive
  manifest field `finish_consumes_audio` (lip-sync does, 0.1.4); for a shot WITH a dialogue line the
  core stable-partitions the finish chain so audio-consuming modules run FIRST -- lipsync -> rife ->
  upscale -- because a lip-sync model's audio->mouth mapping is calibrated to the source frame rate
  and smears across interpolated frames (the breathy look). Non-dialogue shots keep plain ui.order.
  The companion container fix (vivijure-musetalk#32) stops the audio mux from silently re-encoding
  the CRF-18 video at ~2 Mbps (`-c:v copy`). Both #584 mechanisms are dead.
- **Photoreal upscale default (#585, first lever).** finish-upscale (0.1.2) defaults to
  RealESRGAN_x4plus; the anime-tuned realesr-animevideov3 (which imposed an illustration-ish texture
  on photoreal shots, visible at cuts) becomes the explicit anime opt-in. Deeper cross-shot style
  locking is filed as #594.

## v0.16.5

**The S24 sweep burn: every open S23 showcase find fixed in core.** PATCH. Four fixes:

- **Bad clip config bounces BEFORE keyframe spend (#577).** The seedance manifest advertised
  `resolution: 1080p` while the provider accepts only 480p/720p, so a schema-legal value passed the
  clamp and failed every shot after ~17 min of final-tier keyframes. The enum now builds from a
  provider-accepted single source of truth (seedance 0.2.2, pinned by a manifest test), and all
  three keyframe-burning submit doors (film / storyboard render / scatter) judge the RAW caller
  motion_config strictly against the module schema -- unknown key, out-of-set enum, out-of-range
  number, wrong type -- and 400 naming what IS allowed, before any GPU dispatch.
- **Preflight accepts the cast id the API actually gave you (#576).** `castBindings` values resolve
  from the public UUID, the numeric row id, or a numeric string; unresolved values get errors that
  distinguish unknown-id from wrong-id-kind (the misleading "which no longer exists" is gone).
- **Cast voices reach explicit dialogue_lines (#582).** A line without a `voice_id` now resolves
  shot -> speaking slot (bundle storyboard) -> cast voice (cast_loras); an explicit voice_id always
  wins; the default applies only when nothing maps. `cast_loras` joined the MCP submit_film schema,
  and the voicing precedence is documented once (CONTRACT.md 2.20 + docs/mcp.md).
- **The finish record stops claiming adopted work ran (#583, step 1 of the fix).** A finish step
  reused from a prior same-project render's R2 artifact is now recorded in a new `adopted` channel,
  never as a fake `applied`-run tag; the poll summary exposes an `adopted` count. CONTRACT.md 3.3.1
  specifies the producer-written `<outputKey>.hash` param-hash sidecar contract (backend #112
  template) that the satellites/backend implement next; the core adoption gate flips only after
  those producers ship (correctness order: producers first, then the gate).

## v0.16.4

**Keyframe adoption stops feeding the motion backend a hash file (#578), and the MCP escape hatch
works from real clients (#575).** PATCH. Both found live in the S23 showcase component sweep.
The backend's `.hash` param-hash sidecars (backend #112) sort before `.png` in R2, so every ADOPTED
keyframe set (recovery / same-project reuse) handed the motion backend the 16-byte sidecar as its
start image and the whole film failed with a provider image-parse error; `listProjectKeyframes` now
filters to image extensions before shot-id extraction. `studio_request`'s untyped `body` param made
schema-validating MCP clients send a JSON-quoted string (every body-carrying escape-hatch call
400'd); the param is now typed `[object, string]` and a string body is unwrapped before forwarding.
Also this sweep, docs/mcp.md was rewritten to the house docs standard (#570) and the seedance
schema-vs-provider 1080p mismatch was filed (#577, open).

## v0.16.3

**The lipsync degrade reason survives the new backend envelope (#569), and tag deploys stop
tripping on their own guard (#568).** PATCH. musetalk v0.1.2/v0.1.3 (satellite #24: the full
faceless taxonomy -- import-path regression, false-positive bboxes, zero-detection crashes) returns
soft-degrades as `{ok:false, detail}`; finish-lipsync (0.1.3) now records that detail, with `error`
kept as the legacy fallback. CI placeholder guards are comment-aware and use fixed-string grep (the
regex form silently matched nothing on GNU grep).

## v0.16.2

**Voiced films on faceless shots stop hard-failing at lip-sync (#565).** PATCH. RunPod lifts the
musetalk handler's soft-degrade return ({ok:false, error}) into a job-level FAILED envelope, so the
finish-lipsync passthrough branch was unreachable: a legitimate no-face shot failed the whole film
after full keyframe + i2v spend. The module now recognizes the handler's structured ok:false inside
a FAILED envelope (a genuine crash leaves none) and passes the original clip through, recorded as
passthrough:backend-soft-degrade per #77; a real crash still fails loud. Module 0.1.2; first
dedicated finish-lipsync test file. Satellite envelope + early no-face exit tracked in
vivijure-musetalk#24.

## v0.16.1

**The Studio MCP driver ships, and API dialogue actually reaches the film (#563).** PATCH
(retro-added entry; tagged 2026-07-06). `src/mcp.ts` exposes the studio as MCP tools
(projects / cast / storyboard / bundle / preflight / submit + poll film). startFilmJob now remaps
`dialogue_lines` shot ids through the same positional coercion as the scenes (#564), so an API
caller with its own id scheme (s1/s2: Slate, the Studio MCP) no longer ships a silent, uncaptioned
film after paying for TTS.

## v0.16.0

**The studio stops trusting its clips: output validation lands at both layers (#523).** MINOR.
A render engine that returns a structurally broken file, or a "valid" mp4 full of pure noise, is
now caught at the gate instead of being polished and shipped. Layer 1 rejects broken files at
motion-clip intake; Layer 2 rejects garbage pixels at the film finish boundary; both fail the shot
BEFORE any finish/upscale GPU spend, with the real error on the shot. Plus the S20 planner/provision
fix batch.

- **Layer 1: structural mp4 validation at motion-clip intake (#556, #523).** Every adopted clip's
  mp4 box tree is parsed in-Worker from bounded R2 ranged reads (no full download): ftyp/moov
  present, duration/dimension sanity, minimum size. A structurally broken clip fails its shot at
  intake with a `clip.validate` structured event; the fail is sticky (R2 reclaim never re-adopts a
  known-bad clip). Engine-agnostic: applies to own-gpu, cloud i2v, and local-door clips alike.
- **Layer 2: pixel-content validation at the film finish boundary (#558, #557, #523).** The
  video-finish container grows `POST /inspect`: keyframe-vs-first-frame similarity is the primary
  corrupt signal (a noise clip scores ~0.0 against its own keyframe), chroma/structure ratio is the
  warn-only fallback (empirically tuned on real fixtures: noise 5.6-5.7 vs good <= 2.5, threshold
  4.0). Verdicts: `corrupt` fails the shot pre-spend, `suspect` completes the film flagged
  `content_degraded`, an unreachable/older container degrades to `skip` -- content validation never
  hard-fails a render by being absent. Emits `clip.content_validate` structured events.
- **video-finish image fix (#559).** The #558 image build omitted `inspect_core.py` from the
  Dockerfile COPY list (crash-loop on import at container start); one-line fix. Ships as
  `vj-video-finish` 0.2.1; the 0.2.0 image tag is known-broken, never deploy it.
- **Provisioning hardening (#551, #553, #555).** `runpod-provision.py` pins the backend image tag
  by default and rejects bare `:latest`; finish satellites provision with their correct per-service
  R2 env; the upscale satellite pins to its first current-main release `vivijure-upscale:0.2.7`.
- **Planner fixes (#550, #554).** Numeric override fields get bounds hints and the render button
  gates on out-of-bounds values (#544 / #546); the pre-jobId window can no longer re-enable the
  render button mid-submit and double-fire a film (#552).
- **Deploy fixes (#541, #549).** `INSTALL_LOCAL_GPU=1` seeds the local-gpu door secrets so a fresh
  install stops failing with code 10182; deploy.sh surfaces the real planner-mint failure reason
  and validates a reused token before reporting ARMED.
- **Misc (#542, #547).** compose.yaml drops explicit `container_name` so two projects can coexist
  (#533); alibaba-wan-lora pins its seed `config_schema` floor at `min: -1`.
- **Docs (#543, #548).** The free-plan hedge flips to the proven S18 verdict (install free, render
  free, Workers Paid only for the 3 GPU satellites) plus the local-GPU door move recipe; R2 token
  scoping on a first install documented (bucket does not exist yet).

## v0.15.0

**The media stack becomes part of the standard install, and the whole studio is proven live on a
$0 Cloudflare account.** MINOR. The S18 payload: the finish/media containers stop being an optional
tier (the pre-local-door privacy rationale is gone), deploy.sh automates the entire tunnel + VPC
leg, a film that loses its finish container still delivers clips, and the free-plan gate PASSED on
a fresh free-plan account -- full standard install E2E and all THREE render routes (own-gpu
serverless, cloud i2v, local-gpu door) shipped assembled 1080p24 films. The #521 verdict: install
free, render free (pay only usage), Workers Paid ($5/mo) buys ONLY the 3-GPU-satellite suite; a
plan flip needs a core redeploy.

- **Media stack promoted to the standard install; tunnel + VPC fully automated (#519 / #520 /
  #513, #527).** The 5 CPU media containers + cloudflared tunnel + 5 Workers VPC services are now
  part of the default `deploy.sh` run: profiles collapse to `standard` / `satellites`
  (`minimal` / `full` become warn-aliases), `INSTALL_LOCAL_GPU=1` is the separate local-door
  opt-in, and the new `scripts/setup-media-vpc.py` creates/adopts the tunnel, creates the VPC
  services, injects the service ids, and emits a `0600` `tunnel.env`. Only the 3 GPU satellites
  (upscale / lipsync / speech-upscale) remain optional.
- **Degrade to completed-with-clips when video-finish is unavailable (#519, #524).** If
  `VIDEO_FINISH_VPC` is unbound or unreachable after bounded retry at assemble, the film now
  COMPLETES with a loud `finish_unavailable` block (`delivered: "clips"` + presigned clip URLs)
  instead of hard-failing; at mux the degrade delivers a `silent_film`. You can close your laptop
  and still get your clips. A GENUINE container error still fails the render loud with the real
  per-shot error (the #245 / #249 honest-failure guards are untouched).
- **Free-plan subrequest scoping (#521 / #535, #526 + #538).** Root cause of the free-tier
  `Too many subrequests` failures was scan-count, not module-count (a trimmed 18-module install
  still failed): the film tick discovered the registry per interested-module scan, and the
  keyframe->clips transition tick ran TWO full discovery fan-outs (46/50 subrequests before any
  work). Discovery now runs once per film tick (#526) and is threaded request-scoped through the
  clip-job path (#538). Post-fix, all three render routes complete on the free plan's 50-subrequest
  cap.
- **Zombie GPU-job cancel (#536, #538).** The clip orchestrator persists the backend job id per
  shot and best-effort-cancels it on shot failure / job teardown, gated so it fires once; R2
  reclaim runs FIRST, so a clip that already landed is adopted, never cancelled. Kills the class
  where the studio gives up but an H200 keeps burning.
- **Media tunnel adoption + named token scopes (#528 / #531, #532).** `setup-media-vpc.py` now
  adopts an existing `vivijure-media` tunnel instead of creating a split-brain second one, and
  hard-stops if it detects a split (services pointing at a tunnel it did not adopt). Deploy-time
  scope errors now name the exact missing token scope (e.g. `Cloudflare Tunnel:Edit`,
  `Connectivity Directory:Admin`) instead of a bare CF `10000`.
- **Serverless provisioning defaults to datacenter GPUs (#517, #530).** `runpod-provision.py`
  defaults new endpoints to the H200 / B200 pool (the baked-image sm target), not the consumer
  pool a fresh account would otherwise land on.
- **Docs swept to the standard/satellites shape (#529)**; quickstart, DEPLOYMENT, opt-in-tiers,
  CONTRACT and the runbook all describe the post-#519 install (Joan). **Node diagnostic reports
  gitignored (#525)** after a near-miss: a `--report-on-fatalerror` OOM dump (full env, creds
  included) landed in a working tree and was caught by push protection; `report.[0-9]*.json` can
  never be committed again.

## v0.14.3

**S16 backlog burn-down: retire two dead modules, harden the tag deploy, finish the Secrets Store
migration.** PATCH. No new feature surface; three footgun/parity fixes ahead of announce.

- **Retire openai-sora + alibaba-wan25; deploy `EXCLUDE` empty (#306 / #509).** Both were never
  core-bound and never live: openai-sora's un-exclude was gated on the parked Sora build (#184) and still
  carried an unresolved CF `workers.dev/subdomain` first-deploy blocker; alibaba-wan25 was a redundant
  OLDER sibling (Wan 2.5) of the shipped alibaba-wan (Wan 2.6). Deleted both module dirs + their tests,
  swept the two names from 7 sibling `motion.backend` READMEs + the deploy-runbook, and cleared the
  retired plan-enhance-py (#469) leftovers. The CI `EXCLUDE` list goes to empty (the skip-list MECHANISM
  is kept for the next not-ready module). The code is recoverable from git history if #184 revives Sora.
- **Bounded transient-retry in the module-deploy loop (#492 / #510).** The tag-deploy "Deploy module
  workers" step ran `wrangler deploy` per module with no retry, so a single transient Cloudflare API
  hiccup (e.g. the Workflows trigger registration that failed the v0.13.0 deploy) aborted the whole
  ordered deploy under `set -eu`, skipping the core render, D1 migrations, core deploy, and the
  post-deploy gate. Ported deploy.sh's pattern: an `until` retry, up to 3 attempts with a 3s backoff; a
  persistent (non-transient) failure still fails the step loud after the attempts are exhausted. POSIX sh
  / BusyBox ash, now at parity with deploy.sh.
- **speech-upscale bound from the Secrets Store (#238 / #511).** The last secret-bearing module still on
  imperative `wrangler secret put`. Because it deploys via the CI glob loop but CI never runs
  `wrangler secret put`, a CI/fresh deploy shipped it credless -> silent `no-runpod-secrets` passthrough
  (the v0.2.2 finish-upscale class #237 exists to kill). It now binds `RUNPOD_API_KEY` (shared) +
  `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID` (store secret `AUDIO_UPSCALE_RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID`, the vivijure-audio-upscale
  endpoint) from the account Secrets Store via the string-tolerant `secretValue()` resolver; deploy.sh +
  docs updated. This finishes the #238 migration (the core worker and every other secret-bearing module
  were already done).

## v0.14.2

**Every full-render submit path now bounces an unresolved motion backend at the door.** PATCH. Extends
the v0.14.1 / #500 novice-first hardening (a full render with no resolvable motion backend rejects at
submit, not deep at assemble with `no clips rendered to assemble`) to the remaining submit paths, and
closes the planner's default-pick hole.

- **Core preflight on the last two submit paths (#504).** The reusable `motionBackendPreflightError`
  (`src/modules/registry.ts`) is now wired into `hStartFilm` (`POST /api/render/film`) and
  `hScatterRender` (`POST /api/storyboard/render/scatter`), resolving the EXPLICIT `motion_backend` (the
  top-level field or `render_overrides.motion_backend`, NEVER the `serving[0]`/door default) exactly as
  `hSubmitRender` does. Neither endpoint has a keyframes-only mode, so the check is unconditional; both
  reject with a 400 listing the serving `motion.backend` names before any keyframe/shard GPU work. With
  Slate now always sending an explicit backend (slate v0.2.1, `skyphusion-labs/slate#58`), every
  full-render submit path is covered and the `serving[0]`/door default is unreachable for a full render.
- **Planner no-default-force-pick (#501).** With 2+ serving `motion.backend` modules the planner used to
  preselect the order-first door (locality-blind), so a novice clicking straight to submit sent a
  possibly-non-operational door EXPLICITLY -- passing the new submit preflight, then failing downstream.
  Every door radio now starts unchecked and submit blocks with a novice cue, `pick a render backend
  before rendering (Label A, Label B)`, until a door is chosen (or `motion_backend` is supplied via the
  expert JSON). Single-backend and zero-backend cases are unchanged, and a keyframes-only preview is
  exempt (no motion leg). Stays a projection of the registry; no module manifest touched. (Authored by
  Joan, #506.)

## v0.14.1

**Novice-first: a full render with no resolvable motion backend bounces at the door, not deep at assemble.**
PATCH. A full (non-`keyframesOnly`) film render whose effective `motion_backend` did not resolve to an
installed, serving `motion.backend` module used to burn the keyframe phase and then fail with the opaque
`no clips rendered to assemble` (an assemble-leg symptom of a submit-leg cause). It now rejects with a
400 at submit, naming the problem and listing the installed backends, before any keyframe GPU work.

- **Core submit preflight (#500 / #503).** `hSubmitRender` resolves the EXPLICIT `motion_backend` (the
  top-level field or `render_overrides.motion_backend`, NEVER the `serving[0]` default) and returns 400
  with the serving `motion.backend` module names when it does not resolve; `keyframesOnly` renders are
  unaffected (they have no motion leg). New reusable `motionBackendPreflightError(modules, choice)`
  helper (`src/modules/registry.ts`). Root cause confirmed against the live registry: an omitted backend
  defaulted (via `pickOneForHook`) to `serving[0]` = the `local-gpu` door (`ui.order` 4), not
  `alibaba-wan` (order 70), and the door has no seeded backend URL server-side, so the motion phase
  produced zero clips.
- **Planner caller side (#502).** The planner now ALWAYS sends an explicit `motion_backend` when at
  least one serving backend is installed; it previously OMITTED it in the single-backend case (relying
  on the core `serving[0]` default), which the new preflight would have rejected. The pre-existing
  render surface already renders the 400 `{error}` string verbatim, so the novice sees the full backend
  list when a pick is genuinely needed.
- **Follow-ups noted (next-sprint triage, not in this release):** planner default motion-backend pick
  (#501); extend the same preflight to `hStartFilm` + `hScatterRender` once Slate sends an explicit
  backend (#504); the Slate caller-side fix (`skyphusion-labs/slate#58`).

## v0.14.0

**The local-consumer door goes live in production.** The `local-gpu` module (the 12GB LTX "local"
door) is now deployed and bound into the core registry, so the studio routes renders to a
self-hosted GPU backend. MINOR: a new module binds into prod.

- **`local-gpu` deployed + core-bound (#383 / #384).** Flip 1 (#383) dropped `local-gpu` from the CI
  deploy `EXCLUDE` so `vivijure-module-local-gpu` ships on this tag; flip 2 (#384) added the core
  `[[services]]` `MODULE_LOCAL_GPU` binding so the registry discovers the door. The tag lane deploys
  modules BEFORE the core, so the module ships first and the core binds an existing service (no
  dangling-binding failure). The `local-gpu` door slice of #306 is now live.
- **Backend = a disposable RunPod SECURE pod behind a trycloudflare quick tunnel.**
  `LOCAL_BACKEND_URL` + `LOCAL_BACKEND_TOKEN` live in the Cloudflare Secrets Store (freshly seeded,
  verified live through the tunnel), so the module no longer `10182`s on an unseeded binding (the
  v0.7.6 failure). `LOCAL_BACKEND_URL` is re-seeded per pod, and the door FAILS LOUD when no pod is
  attached; it never silently degrades. The old "once the homelab box is up" condition is void (the
  door runs on a RunPod pod, not local hardware).
- **`deploy.sh` is store-first; the planner token is a fail-closed deploy prerequisite (#479 / #498).**
  The one-script self-host deploy now fills the core `store_id`, seeds every core store secret (incl.
  `R2_S3_*`) before the deploys that bind them, and resolves + seeds `CF_AIG_TOKEN` +
  `PLAN_ENHANCE_CF_AIG_TOKEN` up front. A `[[secrets_store_secrets]]` binding to an unseeded store
  secret hard-fails `wrangler deploy` (code `10182`), so the planner token can no longer be an
  "arm-later" step: if it is neither pasted nor auto-mintable the deploy stops early with the exact
  fix, before anything ships. Only `STUDIO_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` stay direct worker
  secrets.

## v0.13.2

**Re-includes `dialogue-gen` + `music-gen` in the module deploy loop now that the Cloudflare
Workflows write path has recovered.** The v0.13.1 re-cut held these two modules (the only ones that
bind a Cloudflare Workflow) on their live versions because `PUT /accounts/{id}/workflows/{name}` was
returning `10001 workflows.api.error.internal_server` (Cloudflare Durable Objects incident in ENAM,
CF support case 02220294, ongoing since 2026-07-02). Their workers stayed live/healthy throughout;
only re-registration on a new tag was blocked, so there was zero functional loss.

- **Cloudflare resolved the incident and closed case 02220294 (2026-07-03).** Verified
  evidence-grade against the live API, not the status email: a throwaway single-`[[workflows]]`
  probe worker deployed clean (the exact `PUT .../workflows/{name}` succeeded, no `10001`), then was
  deleted. The write path is genuinely back.
- **`dialogue-gen` + `music-gen` dropped from the CI `EXCLUDE` and the temp why-comment removed**
  (#493 / #495), mirroring the plan-enhance un-exclude (#476). This tag re-deploys both through the
  loop; no repo/code/config change to the modules themselves.

## v0.13.1

**Same S9 hardening payload as v0.13.0, re-cut so it actually reaches production. The v0.13.0 tag
deploy was blocked by an active Cloudflare Workflows API outage (`10001 internal_server` on the
Workflows write path, ongoing since 2026-07-02), which fails `wrangler deploy` when it re-registers
a module's Workflow trigger. No repo/code/config change; a Cloudflare-side incident.**

- **dialogue-gen + music-gen held on their live versions (temporary).** These are the only two
  modules that bind a Cloudflare Workflow. Both were UNCHANGED in S9 and their workers + workflows
  are already live and healthy, so holding them back re-deploys nothing functional -- the
  re-registration Cloudflare is rejecting is a no-op. They are excluded from the deploy loop until
  the Cloudflare Workflows write path recovers. Tracked in #493 (revert = drop both from the CI
  `EXCLUDE` and re-run the deploy once Cloudflare closes the incident).
- **Everything else in v0.13.0 ships:** the core worker, D1 migration `0010` (opaque `public_id`
  backfill), and the post-deploy gate self-check all deploy normally (the core binds no Workflow).

The full S9 changeset is unchanged from the v0.13.0 entry below (opaque ids F13, spend fail-closed
F7, deploy self-check W3, ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED loudness W4, single-user docs W5). v0.13.0 stays in
history as the Cloudflare-blocked attempt.

## v0.13.0

**S9 strict security hardening: the single-user studio becomes bulletproof-by-default without
Cloudflare Access. Externally-addressable ids are now unguessable, the spend limiter and the deploy
path fail CLOSED, and the docs lean into single-user. BEHAVIOR CHANGES (MINOR): a bare sequential
`:id` no longer resolves, and a broken spend limiter now denies instead of allowing.**

- **Opaque public ids on cast / projects / renders (F13, #487).** `storyboard_projects`,
  `cast_members` and `renders` now expose a UUID-class `public_id` (122 bits) as their ONLY external
  id; the internal INTEGER PK and every internal FK are unchanged. Every `:id` route resolves
  `public_id` -> row, so a bare enumerable integer (`/api/cast/export/1`) now 404s instead of walking
  the library. **Hard cut, no dual-accept window** (pre-announce, prod=dev). Migration `0010_public_ids`
  adds the column and backfills existing rows with a per-row v4 UUID in pure SQL (additive; applied by
  the deploy lane BEFORE the new worker goes live). New rows get `crypto.randomUUID()` on insert.
- **UI consumes the opaque ids (F13 / #489).** The planner frontend routes, fetches and any
  sort/lookup-by-id move off the numeric id onto `public_id`; vanilla JS, still projected from the
  registry.
- **Spend limiter fails CLOSED by default (F7, #488).** A broken or unbound rate/spend limiter now
  DENIES (503) instead of allowing; `SPEND_LIMIT_FAIL_CLOSED="false"` is the documented opt-out. A
  novice self-funding their own GPU has the money path fail closed like everything else.
- **Post-deploy gate self-check (W3, #485).** `deploy.sh` and the tag-deploy CI lane now curl the live
  worker with NO bearer on `/api/*` after deploy and REQUIRE 403; anything else fails LOUDLY (a 200 is
  flagged "your studio may be OPEN"). Automates the v0.12.0 live-matrix proof so an open studio cannot
  ship silently. Bounded ~60s retry absorbs edge-propagation lag; no new secrets.
- **Loud ALLOW_UNAUTHENTICATED signalling (W4, #486).** `deploy.sh` prints an unmissable banner when
  the auth opt-out is present in the rendered config or environment (honest that it is inert under a
  set `AUTH_MODE`), and the in-Worker allow branch emits a structured `{"ev":"auth.allow_unauthenticated"}`
  event so an accidentally-open deploy is queryable in the tail/Loki channel.
- **Honest single-user framing (W5, #490).** `SECURITY.md` stops apologizing for missing
  multi-tenancy and states the model plainly: one operator, one token set, all data is yours; a named
  token is a rotation handle, not an isolation boundary. Updated to match the landed F13/F7 hardening.

## v0.12.1

**The #238 Secrets Store migration completes on the core worker, the R2 S3 presign identifiers
become `[vars]`, and plan-enhance rejoins the deploy loop. Config + deploy only; no behavior change.**

- **Core Secrets Store migration deploys (#238 / #473).** The studio worker's `CF_AIG_TOKEN`,
  `GATEWAY_ID`, `RUNPOD_API_KEY`, `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID` (store `secret_name` `BACKEND_RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID`),
  `R2_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `R2_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` move from `wrangler secret put` to declarative
  `[[secrets_store_secrets]]` bindings; the tag deploy replaces the stale `secret_text` in place.
  `STUDIO_API_TOKEN` stays an operator-minted worker secret. Values are seeded once in the crew
  Secrets Store and never touch CI/GitHub.
- **R2 S3 presign identifiers -> `[vars]` (#475).** `R2_S3_ENDPOINT` + `R2_S3_BUCKET` are identifiers,
  not secrets, so they render into `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` at deploy from `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
  (no wrangler secret, no new CI variable).
- **plan-enhance un-excluded (#476).** Its `PLAN_ENHANCE_CF_AIG_TOKEN` store secret is now seeded, so
  the module rejoins the CI module deploy loop.
- **AUTH_MODE render fails loud when unset.** The core render no longer defaults an unset `AUTH_MODE`
  to `access`; it errors instead (mirroring `deploy.sh`). Since the whole-hostname Access app was
  removed, a silent `access` default would mis-posture prod. `vars.AUTH_MODE` must be set explicitly.

## v0.12.0

**The module-api/1 deprecation window closes and the Secrets Store migration lands, and prod edge auth
flips from Cloudflare Access to the built-in token gate. Config + release only; no behavior regressions.**

- **module-api/1 deprecation window closed (#294).** The first-party modules are migrated
  vivijure-module/1 -> /2 (batches #461-#466, plus #468 for the excluded sora/wan25), closing the #293
  window. Conformance green per module.
- **Secrets Store migration, module half (part of #238).** The non-looped module workers (#462) and the
  plan-enhance module (#470) move their credentials from `wrangler secret put` to declarative
  `[[secrets_store_secrets]]` bindings (GATEWAY_ID, CF_AIG_TOKEN, per-endpoint RunPod ids). Values are
  seeded once in the crew Secrets Store and never touch CI/GitHub.
- **Token-mode edge auth (prod flip).** The studio worker moves AUTH_MODE access -> token: the built-in
  bearer gate (operator token + D1 named per-consumer tokens, #446) becomes the enforced door and the
  Cloudflare Access application is removed from vivijure.skyphusion.org. Drops the Zero-Trust
  prerequisite for self-host; the browser UI supplies the operator bearer via the existing token shim.
- **plan-enhance store migration ships config-complete but deploy-deferred.** Its per-function token
  PLAN_ENHANCE_CF_AIG_TOKEN is not seeded yet, so plan-enhance is temporarily in the CI EXCLUDE list; the
  currently-live worker keeps running untouched and it un-excludes in the #238 core-migration release
  once the token is seeded.
- **plan-enhance-py proof module retired (#306 / #469).** The Python variant is deleted; the TS
  plan-enhance module is the shipped path.
- **planner + data hygiene (#467, #454/#459/#460, #457, #458/#406).** History-list diffability restored
  and keyframe-stage labels genericized/registry-projected; renders-db raw-row shapes typed; the
  speech-upscale RunPod endpoint id genericized in docs.

## v0.11.0

**The structural-debt sprint: per-consumer API tokens, locality-driven classification, contract-carried
finish conventions, and the god-files split -- 21 PRs across the constellation, zero behavior regressions
(1233 tests green throughout).**

- **Named per-consumer bearer tokens (#445 -> #446).** The studio auth-gate now accepts named tokens
  beside the operator login: D1 `api_tokens` (migration 0009) stores SHA-256 hashes only; a match
  authenticates as `api-token:<name>`; deny reasons are identical across credential classes (no oracle).
  `scripts/studio-consumer-token.sh` mints (plaintext lands ONLY in a chmod-600 file), revokes, lists.
  A bot or satellite gets its own independently revocable credential instead of the operator login.
- **Locality-driven motion classification (#448).** The core classifies motion.backend modules by their
  declared `ui.locality`, never by module name. Fixes a live mislabel: a local door serving
  motion.backend passed the old name filter and could become the default "cloud" model. Missing door
  classes now fail honestly, naming the missing locality.
- **Contract-carried finish conventions (#450).** Finish modules declare `finish_artifacts` in the
  manifest (output-key convention + applied-tag rules); the core's R2-authoritative recovery reads the
  declaration instead of regexing binding names. Third-party finish modules can now opt into recovery.
- **God-files split (#451, #453).** `validateStoryboard` decomposed into section validators;
  the pure film model (shapes, summaries, retry/adoption logic, stall math) extracted to
  `src/film-model.ts` with a re-export barrel -- zero test edits either time. `public/planner.js`
  (7224 lines) split into 16 modules with byte-identical-slice proof (#447), i2v labels project
  through the registry (#455).
- **Installer parity (#452).** `vivijure_deploy.py` learns AUTH_MODE token/access: token mode mints
  the operator secret via the same path as deploy.sh (F18-lite keep-unless-rotate) and skips the
  Access app; consumer tokens point at studio-consumer-token.sh, never a second mint.
- **Constellation (same sprint, other repos):** satellite CI unified on semver-tagged immutable images
  (no :latest); musetalk loads models once per warm worker (~5GB reload per job eliminated); the finish
  stage NVENC-encodes with honest CPU fallback and streams interpolation (bounded RAM); the local doors
  share a byte-identical `vivijure_local/core/`; the backend gains a live SECURE-only RunPod pod client,
  proven by a paid smoke that caught two real bugs before any gate depended on it.

## v0.10.0

**Deploy ratification + the fix-it-all sprint: a cold deploy provisions everything (planner armed,
gateway created, tokens minted once), renders fail honestly instead of masking or leaking spend, and
concurrency/spend safety get real guards.**

- **One-script cold deploy, ratified end to end.** deploy.sh now arms the storyboard planner cold
  (auto-mints the AI-Gateway Run token when the deploy token can, with a paste fallback; #434),
  script-creates the AI Gateway itself with authentication + cache-invalidate-on-update ON at birth
  (#442), serves on workers.dev hostnames (#433), preflights npm ci (#432), and STOPS reminting
  `STUDIO_API_TOKEN` on re-runs -- saved logins survive; `--rotate-token` mints fresh (#442). The
  provisioner writes the env names the backend handler actually reads (#438). Proven by a virgin
  re-run: green end to end, zero interventions.
- **Honest RunPod polls (F17/#141, all 16 RunPod-driving modules; #440).** A backend whose error
  path leaves the job status stuck now gets its structured error surfaced (stage + message + job id)
  instead of polling forever and masking as "job not found"; the module cancels the hung job so it
  stops billing the worker; and a virgin endpoint's image pull no longer false-fails the first-ever
  job (the poll consults `/health` and waits out a genuine cold start, bounded at 15 min).
- **No more double-submits.** `advanceFilmJob` runs under a whole-tick D1 lease (migration 0007), so
  the 1-min cron and client polls can no longer race the same phase transition into duplicated GPU
  spend; the loser reads the job read-only (#439).
- **Spend posture knobs (#441).** `SPEND_LIMIT_FAIL_CLOSED` flips the F3 rate-limit guard to deny
  (503) when the limiter itself is broken; `SPEND_DAILY_CEILING` caps spend-route submissions per UTC
  day in D1 (migration 0008), returning 429 until midnight. Both off unless set.
- **Contract consistency (additive, no api bump; #443).** `score` output gains the shared `degraded`
  chain convention; `film.finish`'s optional `applied` is now a documented decision, and conformance
  type-checks both when present.
- **Docs tell the token-mode truth (#435-#437).** Quickstart/README/DEPLOYMENT rewritten for the
  shipped token auth (Access is optional hardening), the deploy docs match the ratified script, and
  teardown deletes the auto-minted Run token.

## v0.9.0

**Browser-grade media serving (#416): HTTP byte ranges on artifacts and worker-authoritative cache
headers.**

- **Byte-range requests on `/api/artifact`.** The artifact route ignored `Range` entirely, so
  Safari/iOS (which require ranged media) could not play planner films at all and a Chrome seek
  refetched from byte 0. It now advertises `Accept-Ranges: bytes` and serves 206 + `Content-Range`
  for closed, open-ended, and suffix ranges, a true 416 with `bytes */size` when out of bounds, a
  graceful full 200 on malformed or multi-part ranges, and supports HEAD (#421).
- **Cache headers are the worker's job now.** Bare non-page responses default to `no-store` at the
  response chokepoint (set-if-absent), artifacts keep `private, max-age=300`, and static assets keep
  the ASSETS binding's revalidate-always header. A deployment is cache-correct without any zone-level
  bypass rule; ours is reframed in the docs as optional hardening, so outsider deployments no longer
  depend on a dashboard setting they cannot see (#421).

## v0.8.4

**Planner regression sweep closes (#411): the NULL-string mapping fix and a module-bound local dev
environment.**

- **SQL NULL no longer serialized as the string "null".** The renders list mapped NULL
  `project` / `bundle_key` / `quality_tier` through a bare `String()`, shipping the literal, truthy
  string `"null"` to the planner: "null" labels and download names, and a bundle-less row that looked
  re-render eligible. Those fields now coerce to `""` like the sibling nullable fields, so the
  planner's existing truthiness gating is correct with no frontend change (#418).
- **Module-bound local dev environment.** `.dev-modbound/dev-modbound.sh` runs the core plus every
  in-tree module worker in one local `wrangler dev` fleet: the real 25-module catalog projects into
  the planner while every module invoke stays inert (binding-free dev configs; no GPU or provider
  spend possible). Includes a dev-only planner AI mock (`PLANNER_AI_MOCK`, unset in prod, live path
  unchanged) whose canned output runs the real extract/parse/validate pipeline, with sentinels for
  pass, validator-reject, and parse-failure. Closes the dev-parity gap the sweep surfaced; recipe in
  `docs/dev-modbound.md` (#419).

## v0.8.3

**Planner regression-sweep fixes (#411): the keyframe lightbox and the dead progress-stream path.**

- **Keyframe lightbox is styled.** Clicking a keyframe thumbnail opened an overlay whose classes had
  no CSS at all, dumping an unstyled full-size image at the page bottom (same never-implemented class
  as the v0.8.2 player fix). The lightbox is now a fixed full-viewport overlay: image contained and
  aspect-preserved at any shape (2x-upscaled, portrait, 1:1), backdrop + Escape dismiss (#412).
- **Dead render-progress stream removed.** The planner opened an SSE connection to a `/stream`
  endpoint that never existed server-side, so every render flashed "stream closed; falling back to
  8s polling" before polling anyway. The dead client path is gone; the 8-second poll on the
  structured status channel is the single, silent mechanism. Server-side SSE is tracked as a
  post-announce enhancement (#414, #415).

## v0.8.2

**Planner: upscaled films display correctly; hook-contract enforcement at runtime; support/security
contact docs.**

- **Upscaled clips no longer blow out the history card.** The inline film player and per-shot motion
  clips had no CSS sizing, so a 2x-upscaled MP4 rendered at intrinsic resolution and the card's
  `overflow:hidden` clipped it to a blown-up crop. Players now size to the card and keep the clip's
  own aspect (#410). Trigger for the full planner regression sweep (#411).
- **Runtime hook-contract enforcement (F5b).** The core now validates a module's terminal output
  against its hook contract at the orchestrator consumption seams (render, film, score, cast-image);
  an envelope-correct but malformed payload takes that seam's existing honest-degrade with a
  traceable per-module reason instead of being threaded downstream (#345, #408).
- **Support and security contact docs.** `SUPPORT.md` (GitHub Issues first, support@skyphusion.org
  next) and a root `SECURITY.md` reporting policy (private reports to security@skyphusion.org,
  linking the `docs/SECURITY.md` posture doc) now ship in this and every constellation repo (#409).

## v0.8.1

**Pre-announce polish: honest public docs, a cleaner deploy front door, and edge-cache purge on release.**

- **Welcome page reflects the real constellation.** The "how it fits together" table now lists both
  local self-host doors (`vivijure-local-12gb` / `-16gb`) and all three finish satellites
  (`vivijure-musetalk` / `-upscale` / `-audio-upscale`), with a pointer to `docs/constellation.md`. The
  stale "seven motion backends" claim is replaced with backend-agnostic wording (#403).
- **Deploy hygiene.** The real account Secrets Store id is templated out of the public module configs
  behind a `REPLACE_WITH_VIVIJURE_SECRETS_STORE_ID` placeholder; `deploy.sh` (outsider path) fills it
  from the operator's store and CI fills it from the `SECRETS_STORE_ID` repo variable, fail-closed, so
  a tag deploy never ships a dangling `[[secrets_store_secrets]]` binding. `deploy/vivijure_deploy.py`
  is demoted to a labelled alternative so `deploy.sh` is the single documented front door. The
  speech-upscale opt-in now names its per-module `RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID` secret (#404).
- **Edge-cache purge on release.** The tag-gated deploy job now purges the Cloudflare edge cache for
  `/welcome` and `/` after the core deploys, so a release stops serving a stale welcome page. Opt-in
  and self-host safe: a no-op unless `CF_ZONE_ID`, `CF_PURGE_HOST`, and `CF_CACHE_PURGE_TOKEN` are all
  set; honest failure (the worker is already live, so a purge error never rolls back) (#405).

## v0.8.0

**Workers-for-Platforms dynamic dispatch goes live: install a module without redeploying the core.**

- **WfP dispatch enabled in prod (Phase 3 deploy).** The `vivijure-modules` dispatch namespace is
  created and the core now binds `MODULE_DISPATCH`, so a module uploaded into the namespace is reached
  at request time via `env.MODULE_DISPATCH.get(<script>).fetch(...)` -- no core redeploy to install one.
  This lands the host-side dispatch work (#391 / #392 / #393) as a running capability; `GET /api/modules`
  now reports `host.dispatch: true`. Conformance-gated install routes + the operator CLI drive uploads.
- **Free-self-host promise preserved, by construction.** The `[[dispatch_namespaces]]` block still ships
  COMMENTED in `wrangler.toml.example`. Our prod render uncomments it only when the repo variable
  `ENABLE_WFP_DISPATCH == "1"` (set once, after the namespace exists); a community fork never sets it, so
  its render stays commented and deploys on the free plan with zero WfP dependency. The dispatch layer is
  also runtime-gated on `MODULE_DISPATCH` being bound, so behavior is identical when it is absent.
- `local-gpu` stays in the CI deploy EXCLUDE: under WfP the multi-tenant local door becomes a
  per-tenant namespace upload, not a `[[services]]` deploy -- a follow-on once tenant onboarding lands.

## v0.7.7

- **Exclude the WIP `local-gpu` module from deploy (#382).** It has no core `[[services]]` binding and its Secrets Store secrets are unseeded, so its deploy failed (code 10182) and broke v0.7.6. Fenced out until the homelab door lands.

## v0.7.6

- **Planner: BYO locality tag + bind the finalize gate to the BYO door (#381).** Three-value locality (local | byo | cloud) surfaced to the planner; finalize gated behind the BYO door.

## v0.7.5

- **Run the worker on static pages so security headers actually land (#377).** Re-fixes header stamping on `/welcome` and all pages without the redirect loop v0.7.3 introduced.

## v0.7.4

- **Revert `run_worker_first` (#375).** It broke `/welcome` with a 307 redirect loop; reverted pending the correct fix (landed in v0.7.5).

## v0.7.3

- **`run_worker_first` so the worker stamps headers on `/welcome` + all pages (#374).** Reverted in v0.7.4, superseded by v0.7.5.

## v0.7.2

- **Substitute `WEB_ANALYTICS_TOKEN` in the wrangler.toml render (#373).** The analytics beacon token now renders from the Actions secret.

## v0.7.1

- **Render wrangler.toml BEFORE applying D1 migrations (#372).** `wrangler d1` needs the rendered config to resolve the D1 binding and `migrations_dir`.

## v0.7.0

- **Worker-owned security headers on every response class (#371).** One source of truth for headers across page, API, and asset responses.

## v0.6.6

- **Durable module secrets via Cloudflare Secrets Store (#237).** Module secrets bind declaratively from the account Secrets Store, so a fresh-create can no longer start secretless and silently degrade.

## v0.6.5

- **Open a character on load so highlight + detail pane stay in sync (#146).**

## v0.6.4

- **Reconcile LoRA training rows wedged in `training` back to `failed` (#295).**

## v0.6.3

- **Exclude not-ready modules from deploy (#305):** openai-sora, alibaba-wan25, plan-enhance-py.

## v0.6.2

- **Fix exit-127 in the dynamic module deploy (#304).** POSIX sh only, no bash-isms (the CI container's `/bin/sh` is BusyBox ash).

## v0.6.1

- **Deploy ALL modules dynamically, not a hardcoded include-list (#303).** Fixes deploy-drift where a new module was forgotten and the live worker served stale.

## v0.6.0

- **Operator install-config page, registry-projected (#301).** Per-module install config edited from a settings page projected off the registry.

## v0.5.0

- **Strip `user_email` to zero: identity-free, anti-SaaS by architecture (#292 / #293).** No user identity is stored; the studio is self-hosted software, not a data-collecting service.

## v0.4.2

- **Write the runnable R2 doc before the D1 rows so a submit cannot orphan a render (#289 / #290).**

## v0.4.1

- **Fail loud on a partial assemble (#287 / #288).** Never silently complete a 1-of-N scatter gather.

## v0.4.0

- **Run the `film.finish` chain on the scatter gather (#286).** Subtitles and title/credit cards applied on the scatter assemble path.

## v0.3.3

- **Clamp seedance duration minimum to 4 (#279 / #282).** The endpoint allows [4,12] and 400s on 3.

## v0.3.2

- **Wire `tail_consumers` -> `vivijure-tail` (#278).** Deploy-ordered observability tail consumer.

## v0.3.1

- **Make the keyframe backend user-selectable (#275).** cloud-keyframe becomes reachable alongside the GPU keyframe.

## v0.3.0

- **Wire every `config_schema`-bearing hook end to end (#274):** speech + film.finish + master config knobs plumbed through; gated the v0.3.0 cut.

## v0.2.6

**Launch prep: fail-loud finish, the talking showcase, and the render-pipeline diagram.**

- **Fail loud on a failed finish chain (#245 / #249):** a finish step that genuinely fails (after the bounded retry + R2 reclaim) now fails the render with the real per-shot error instead of silently advancing to done and shipping the raw i2v clip with `applied=[]`. `clipKeysFromFilmJob` returns finished clips only when a finish chain was set up, never substituting a raw clip for a non-done shot. The honest-failures safety net: a finish failure can no longer ship a green-but-unfinished film.
- **Welcome page + README:** the "Vivijure Speaks" talking-character showcase on the public welcome page (#240), and a render-pipeline mermaid diagram in the README (storyboard to keyframe to dialogue + motion.backend to the finish chain to assemble to mux).
- Pairs with **backend-v0.2.27** (the RIFE pad-to-64 fix, verified live VOICED+FULL on a non-64 resolution): the finish chain now runs on every cloud i2v output dimension, so all seven motion backends do the full lip-sync + upscale path.
- **693 tests**, typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.5

**Preflight fix: the pre-render safety check actually runs now.** Found in a full planner regression pass.

- **preflight route wired + envelope unwrapped (#242 / #243):** `src/preflight.ts` (the real validator: shape + cast-readiness) was written but never imported, so `/api/storyboard/preflight` only ran the shape gate against the wrong object: it read `.title`/`.scenes` off the `{storyboard, castBindings}` envelope (undefined) and returned HTTP 400 on every valid storyboard. The client threw on the non-2xx and showed only "HTTP 400" with no reasons, and its bundle gate never activated. The handler now unwraps `.storyboard`, runs the full chain (validateStoryboard -> checkStoryboardShape -> checkCastBindingsReady -> summarize), and returns the PreflightResult at HTTP 200 with `ok:false` + structured issues for a storyboard-with-problems (validation findings are data, not an HTTP failure). The client now renders the issues and the bundle gate works. D1 is only queried when cast bindings are present.
- **690 tests** (8 new preflight-route tests incl. the exact old-bug payload as a regression guard), typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.4

**Cloud i2v duration enum fix.** Unblocks the cloud motion backends for short shots.

- **kling + wan duration snap (#241):** the Kling ({5,10}) and Wan 2.6 ({5,10,15}) cloud i2v modules accept only a discrete duration enum, not a continuous range; the old continuous clamp passed a 4s shot straight through and the provider 400'd at submit (so a cloud talking render failed before any clip rendered). Duration now snaps UP to the smallest allowed value at or above the per-shot seconds (4s -> 5; a 7s shot -> 10, never clipped shorter than the shot). The other six cloud modules likely share the bug; tracked as follow-up.
- **683 tests**, typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.3

**Finish-chain self-heal: a GC'd or frozen mid-chain finish step now recovers from R2.** Builds on v0.2.2's silent-render fixes.

- **R2-presence advance for any finish step (#239):** when a finish step's RunPod poll job is GC'd-after-complete (a 404) or freezes IN_PROGRESS (poll pends forever), and that step's OWN expected output is already in R2, the orchestrator folds it in and advances to the next module -- instead of polling a ghost job to the hard deadline. This fixes the wedge where RIFE completed and its output landed in R2 but the finish chain never advanced, so lip-sync was never dispatched and the shot pended forever. Per-step advance on the step's own artifact (not final-artifact adoption), so the remaining modules still run -- it cannot ship a half-finished clip.
- **682 tests**, typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.2

**The talking-character showcase fix: a scatter film keeps its voice end to end.** Builds on v0.2.1's self-heal so the orchestration now reliably delivers per-shot dialogue + lip-sync through gather and assemble.

- **Scatter keeps clip audio (#234):** when a render has dialogue, the gather concat now preserves each lip-synced clip's baked-in audio (and silent-pads an audio-less clip to a uniform track), instead of stripping all audio and producing a silent film.
- **No mid-chain finish adoption (#234):** a finish shot whose module fails mid-chain is no longer adopted from its intermediate R2 clip as "done" -- only the chain's final artifact is adoptable, so a failed lip-sync can no longer masquerade as a finished (silent) clip.
- **Bounded finish-step retry (#234):** a transient finish-module blip (5xx / timeout / lost poll token) re-dispatches the step up to 3 attempts; a deterministic reject (4xx / no face) still fails loud -- so a momentary MuseTalk cold-start no longer silences a shot.
- **Watchdog spares D1-blocked shards (#230):** a shard that is merely retrying a transient D1 error is no longer declared dead by the watchdog.
- **voiced-verify (#236):** a `scripts/` checker that gates a render on per-shot lip-sync + non-silent audio (volumedetect), not just stream presence.
- **677 tests**, typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.1

**Production hardening: tag-gated deploys + render self-heal.** First release cut under the new tag gate.

- **Tag-gated deploys (#228):** a push/merge to `main` now runs typecheck + test only; the Cloudflare deploy (module workers -> D1 migrations -> core) fires ONLY on a pushed `v*` SemVer tag. A merge can no longer redeploy production or interrupt an in-flight render.
- **D1 transient self-heal (#229):** the render-advance hot path retries transient `D1_ERROR` internal blips (4 attempts, short backoff) while constraint / SQL errors still fail fast, so a momentary D1 hiccup no longer wedges a shard until the watchdog -- the every-60s sweep now genuinely self-heals.
- **trainLoras fails hard (#227):** a render bound to a character with no trained cast LoRA now 400s naming the character ("train them on the Cast page first") instead of silently inline-retraining the LoRA every render.
- **665 tests**, typecheck-clean.

## v0.2.0

**Phase 1: render API + studio UI.** The film studio is fully home in this worker; the AI Playground
(`skyphusion-llm-public`) no longer owns render or planner routes.

- **Render spine:** film orchestrator (keyframe -> motion -> finish -> assemble), scatter-gather,
  render-from-keyframes, regen-shot, cron sweep for orphaned jobs, module-driven overrides UI.
- **Cast:** training-set gen via `cast.image`, LoRA train/status, portrait + multi-scene image chat,
  ref/source management, artifact copy from chat outputs.
- **Library:** renders CRUD, finalize / animate-cloud / animate-hybrid, adopt backfill, prefs,
  notify hook (`notify-email` module).
- **Authoring:** plan / refine / yaml / markers / bundle / score-bed / beat analyze / enhance chain.
- **Eleven module workers** bound in `wrangler.toml` (keyframe, own-gpu, seedance, kling, finish-rife,
  cast-image, notify-email, music-gen, narration-gen, beat-sync, plan-enhance).
- **368+ tests**, typecheck-clean CI.

## v0.1.0

**Phase 0: the module host.** First cut of Vivijure Studio as a standalone Cloudflare Worker, split
out of `skyphusion-llm-public` so the AI Playground and the film studio no longer share a roof.

- **The module contract (`vivijure-module/1`)** in `src/modules/types.ts`: hooks, manifest,
  `invoke` envelope, reference `finish` payloads.
- **The registry** in `src/modules/registry.ts`: discovers `MODULE_*` bindings, validates manifests,
  clamps config, indexes by hook.
- **`GET /api/modules`** plus the **self-assembling frontend** (`public/`): UI is a projection of
  the registry; zero modules installed is a valid lean studio.
- **`docs/module-api.md`**: the design spec.
- Tests cover manifest validation, hook indexing, discovery against faked bindings.
